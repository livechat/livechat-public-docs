2. Click **New app +** and follow the app wizard.
3. In the **Display details** tab, enter your application name, description, and icon.
4. Go to **Agent App Widgets -> New Widget +**.
  * Enter the **Widget source URL**.
  * Select the desired location as the **Widget placement**.
5. Go to the **Private installation** tab and install the app on your account. 

After successful installation, you'll see the widget in your LiveChat Agent App.

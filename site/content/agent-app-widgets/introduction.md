# Introduction

Agent App Widgets are web applications loaded inside the **LiveChat Agent App**. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the sidebar of the Agent App:

<!--## Overview

This tool is a simple JavaScript SDK, which allows you to communicate with LiveChat Agent App from within the embedded widget.-->

## Use cases

Widgets are primary elements of Agent App interface. There are number of ways you can use the them:

* embed and display static content, e.g. knowledge base articles, conversation prompts or context information,
* embed your SaaS service or web app as a part of agents' workspace,
* query external services with visitor email or LiveChat group ID (CRM, marketing automation, etc.),
* create store with [in-app purchases](/docs/billing-api) to sell additional services or features of your app,
* query [LiveChat REST API](/docs/rest-api) to do basically anything with the visitor, agent or chat.

## Important notes

From a technical point of view, widgets are regular web applications. For that reason, you need to have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your own widget. 

Bear in mind that widgets are front-end elements of the LiveChat Agent App. If your intention is to build a server-side app, we encourage you to check out the [REST API documentation](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/rest-api/).

# Sample application

This sample app will display a chat trigger button. Once clicked, a chat window with your support team will be opened in the app. 

You can refer to our sample `app` in the module. There are examples for three usage cases:

* Full screen Chat Window launched inside of an Activity
* Embedded Chat Window launched from a Fragment
* Starting ChatWindowActivity (with limited capabilities)

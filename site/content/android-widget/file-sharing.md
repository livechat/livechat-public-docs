# File sharing

If you want the users to be able to send files, you need to set `ChatWindowEventsListener` on your `ChatWindowView` and allow the view to handle the activity result:

```java
@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (fullChatWindow != null) fullChatWindow.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}
```

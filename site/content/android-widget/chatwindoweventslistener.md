# ChatWindowEventsListener

This listener allows you to:

*	handle a case when a user wants to attach a file in the **ChatWindow**
*	get notified if a new message has arrived in a chat (this comes in handy if you want to show a prompt for a user to read the new message)
*	react to visibility changes (the users can hide the view on their own)

# Introduction

LiveChat uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for **authentication** and **authorization** for all of its services. Before you continue, make sure you understand the following difference:

* **Authentication** is making sure that somebody really is who they say they are. <br/>_E.g.: Checking your passport at the security check is authentication._
* **Authorization** is assigning rules about who is allowed to do what. <br/>_E.g.: Allowing you to take first class seat is authorization._

## Overview

In terms of LiveChat apps, authentication is when you check the user credentials to see if they are signed in. Authorization is when you look up whether you allow them to do something. There are [five authorization flows](#authorization-flows) available for different ways of interacting with LiveChat APIs. 

## Basic use cases

### Authorizing REST API calls
> `Authorization` header example in LiveChat [REST API](/docs/rest-api) call:

```shell
curl "https://api.livechatinc.com/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "X-API-Version: 2"
```

The most popular tool used by developers is [REST API](/docs/rest-api). Calling API methods on behalf of LiveChat user is as simple as including `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` HTTP header in each call. Find out how to acquire the `access_token` in the sections below.

### Authentication service

You can authenticate users of your app using LiveChat authorization flows. You can leverage the existing LiveChat user base and distribute apps for the community of LiveChat users without the need of building your own authentication service.

### Connect with LiveChat

Let's say you have a service which can import chat data from the external sources. You can use a [Sign in with LiveChat SDK](#sign-in-with-livechat) to create something like _"Connect with LiveChat"_ button. This way your users can connect their LiveChat accounts to your service with just a few clicks.

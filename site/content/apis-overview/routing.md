# Routing

Routing is the process of **assigning chats to agents**. The primary goal of the routing mechanism is to distribute chats to all available agents at a single license .

This section describes chat.io default product routing. In the future it will be possible to create a custom routing mechanism and run it on chat.io platform.

In chat.io product it's not possible for a customer to have multiple chats within a single license. The conversation within a license (i.e. a company) is continuous from the customer's perspective and it's not necessary to split it into multiple chats.

Agents are assigned chats **either automatically or manually**, depending on the routing settings.

## Manual routing

## System messages

While the routing switches states (as shown in the diagrams above), the router will send system messages (see [Events](#system-message) section) to a chat.

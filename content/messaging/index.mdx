# Introduction

This document is dedicated to a set of **Messaging APIs**, which consists of the **Agent Chat API**, **Customer Chat API**, and the **Configuration API**. It also explains some key concepts, such as the definition of a **chat** and a **thread**, **the flow between services**, or **chat routing**. Understanding them is a prerequisite to the efficient usage of our APIs.

This document is a great starting point if you plan on using our APIs. You'll learn what use cases can be covered with each API. For hands-on examples, we encourage you to check the documentation specific to each API.

# Key concepts

## Chats and threads

By looking at the chat structure, you notice that each **chat** is is divided into **threads**. Every thread contains **events**, for example sent messages. You can think of a **chat** as _**a whole conversation**_, while **threads** are separate _**conversation topics**_.

![Chats and Threads](images/chat_threads.png "chats and threads")

Consider the example of an online store. A customer starts a chat to ask about the shoes he bought. If he hasn't got any previous chat history, **a new chat is started**. Within this chat, **a new thread is created** (conversation topic). The messages he exchanges with the customer service assistant are received by the thread as **events**. After solving the problem, the customer says goodbye and closes the chat, which automatically **closes the thread**. Let's say the customer is rude and leaves without saying goodbye. In this case, the thread closes after 30 minutes of inactivity (time periods are configurable). The chat **doesn't end**, though.

The next day, customer returns to ask about his other purchase. A new thread starts in the context of the chat, which has been **continuously open**. Each time customer returns and starts a new conversation topic, he needs to click **_start a chat_**. If we stuck to our naming convention, that would have to be **_start a thread_**, because this is what he actually does behind the scenes.

A **message** or **rich message** are not the only event type≈õ, though. There are also special events for specific actions, like: **file**, **filled form**, **system** and **custom** messages.

### Rules and conditions

Here are some general rules, which summarize the previous section and add new info.

1. When a new chat is started, **a new active thread** is created within this chat. New threads within a single chat are created on the server side.

2. There's always **only one active thread**. Only the **last thread** can be the **active** one. Events are always added to the active thread.

3. There can be time gaps between threads in a chat, but once a chat is started, it's **continuously open**.

4. Messages are sent and delivered even when the recipient (both Customer and Agent) is **offline**.

5. **Multiple Agents** can participate in a single chat.

6. Every user can have **multiple concurrent chats**. Read how it applies to [Agents](#chatting-as-agent) and [Customers](#chatting-as-customer).

7. The algorithm that decides how chats are distributed between Agents is called **routing**. It's documented in the [Routing](#chat-routing) section.

### The flow

To better understand the flow between services, watch a short video.

</video>

## Chat routing

Routing is the process of **assigning chats to agents**. The primary goal of the routing mechanism is to distribute chats to all available agents who use the same license.

Chats are being assigned to agents **either automatically or manually**. Our default routing mechanisms are described in [Understanding chat routing](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/understanding-chat-routing/).

### Router system messages

While the chat changes its state, the router sends system messages. Read more about **system messages** in [Agent Chat API](./agent-chat-api/#system-message) and [Customer Chat API](./customer-chat-api/#system-message).

# APIs Overview

There are two primary Chat APIs:

- **Agent Chat API**, which serves to join a chat as Agent.
- **Customer Chat API**, which serves to join a chat as Customer.

The separation of Chat APIs helps you decide which set of methods you should use. It depends on the role of the chat user. Want to join a chat as Agent? Refer to the Agent Chat API. Want to send messages as Customer? Use the Customer Chat API.

To use both APIs, you need to be _authorized_. This topic is thoroughly explained in the [**Authorizing API calls**](../getting-started/authorization) document.

## RTM API vs. Web API

Agent Chat API and Customer Chat API can be used either as **Real-Time Messaging APIs (RTM APIs)** or **Web APIs**.

To learn about differences between these two API types, see the comparison below:

If you're not sure, which implementation to choose, we suggest reading about particular APIs. You'll find the **When to use RTM/Web API** section in each document - refer to the table above for links.

# Agent Chat API

## Use cases

The **Agent Chat API** allows for:

- interactions with the chat as Agent (joining a chat, posting messages)
- interact with the chat by Bot Agents (acting as Agents)
- building a custom Agent App
- browsing chat archives
- banning Customers
- and much more

If you plan on using the **Agent Chat API** as **RTM API**, refer to [Agent Chat RTM API](./agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/). For the **Web API** usage, read the [Agent Chat Web API](./agent-chat-api/) document.

## Chatting as Agent

The number of chats an Agent can participate in is not limited. It can be configured in the Agent App by the license Owner or Admin.

# Customer Chat API

## Use cases

The **Customer Chat API** allows for:

- interacting with the chat as Customer (join a chat, post messages)
- building a custom Chat Widget
- implementing new conversation channels (Facebook Messenger or Twitter)

If you plan on using the **Customer Chat API** as **RTM API**, refer to [Customer Chat RTM API](./customer-chat-api/rtm-reference/). For the **Web API** usage, read the [Customer Chat Web API](./customer-chat-api/) document.

## Chatting as Customer

By default, a Customer can only have one chat started, unless he chats with Agents who use different licences. The licence Owner or Admin can change that default value, modifying the `routing.max_customer_chats_count` property. However, in order to support this functionality, you would need to build a custom Chat Widget. For now, the LiveChat Chat Widget doesn't support it. You can build a Chat Widget from the ground up using the [Chat Widget Customer SDK](../extending-ui/extending-chat-widget/customer-sdk/).

Chats are continuous so Customers can always preview their chats' history. Yet, with **multiple concurrent chats** Customers can sort their chats out thematically, making sure they know what each chat is about.

# Configuration API

## Use cases

The [**Configuration API**](/management/configuration-api/) allows for:

- storing license configurations
- creating chat, thread, and event [properties](/management/configuration-api/#properties)
- managing [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks), for example registering and unregistering
- managing [Bot Agents](/management/configuration-api/#bot-agents), for example creating and removing

In the near future, it will allow for groups configuration. For now, refer to [**Configuration API v2**](/management/configuration-api-v2/#groups) to manage groups properties.

## Properties

Properties are **key-value storages**. They can be set within a chat, a thread, or an event. You can create properties within a license and configure them using the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/). It's possible to configure the property [type](../management/configuration-api/#property-types), [location](../management/configuration-api/#property-locations), and [domain](../management/configuration-api/#property-domain).

Refer to the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) document to read more about the [property format](/management/configuration-api/#properties) and available [endpoints](/management/configuration-api/#methods-1).

## Webhooks

In general, actions invoked by the use of Messaging APIs result in events. You can be notified about those events with **webhooks**. LiveChat provides a number of webhooks, which you can register and manage via the [Configuration API](../management/configuration-api/#webhooks).
We distinguish **global webhooks** and **bot-specific webhooks**. Once **global webhooks** are set up, you will always receive them. **Bot-specific** webhooks are strongly coupled with the bot's status (`accepting chats`, `not accepting chats`, `offline`). If the bot is offline, webhooks won't be received.
Webhook equivalents in the websocket transport (RTM API) are **pushes**.

## Bot Agents

Bot Agents are similar to their human counterparts. They can join chats and post messages, but they also have a special feature: you can attach [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks) to them.

Bot Agents are created and managed via the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#bot-agent). As standard agents, Bot Agents can use Agent Chat API by the web API or websocket connection ([see the difference](#rtm-api-vs-web-api)).

Bot Agents are authorized with the use of the Agent's token. Using Bot Agents requires sending the `author_id` property.
They can listen for incoming webhooks (or [pushes](messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#pushes)) and react to them.

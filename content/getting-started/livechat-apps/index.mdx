# Introduction

Apps are primary elements of LiveChat Platform.

Customize the interface of LiveChat, implement your own chat widget, or automate a variety of tasks. Create minor tweaks for your team, build integrations with other platforms, or create new products in the LiveChat ecosystem.

# App capabilities

LiveChat Platform provides multiple tools for developers, so that your app can do the following and other things:

- Integrate with other products and services
- Extend LiveChat user interfaces
- Automate tasks with webhooks
- Read and write LiveChat data
- Implement a custom Chat Widget
- Let users sign in to your service with Sign in with LiveChat
- Send & receive rich messages with [Chat APIs](/messaging/)

Are you building an app for everyone? We provide simple [monetization](/monetization/how-to-monetize-apps/) and distribution tools.

# Creating LiveChat apps

To create LiveChat Apps you need an account in [Developer Console](https://developers.livechat.com/console/). It's a panel dedicated to managing and distributing your apps.

1. Sign in to [Developer Console](https://developers.livechat.com/console/).
2. Go to the [Apps](https://developers.livechat.com/console/apps/) section.
3. Create a new app!

## Common questions

### What's an app in LiveChat?

An app is anything that LiveChat Platform is able to interpret. It could be an integration with a 3rd party service, a custom plugin to display additional visitor details or a chat widget theme. We constantly work to introduce new types of apps and ways of integrating with LiveChat.

- **From developer perspective:** <br/>Technically speaking, every app a set of attributes (you can think of it as a JSON file). These attributes define the type and meta details of the app. Every app can also have a OAuth2.0 Client associated. Every app instance (installation) is associated with dedicated authorization entities.

- **From business perspective:** <br/>The primary goal of an app is to abstract some functionality in an installable package, which can be published and distributed at the [Apps Marketplace](https://my.livechatinc.com/marketplace). App can also remain private and available only for the license it was created on.

### Who can create and manage apps?

Currently, only **owner** and **administrators** can create and manage apps. If you have an agent account willing to create and manage apps, please contact your license administrator or owner.

### Do I have to publish the app to use it?

No, It's perfectly fine to create only private apps. If your team needs a certain functionality, you don't have to publish the app for the team to use it.

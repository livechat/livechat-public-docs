# Welcome to LiveChat!

If you're wondering whether LiveChat would suit your business, this is the place for you to get started. We'd like to tell you about our product, its main functionalities as well as its high potential to be customized. Let's take you on a small tour!

# What LiveChat is

**LiveChat** helps you handle conversations with the customers who visit your websites. Customers can start chats with your agents, but it can also be the other way round. Your agents can initiate chats, making your visitors feel welcome and valued. If you're up to some automation, you can engage them in a conversation with [**greetings**](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/why-should-i-set-up-chat-greetings/). Also, delegating some work to [**bots**](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/chatbots-explained/) is an option when running a bussines on a bigger scale.

Your customers can start multiple conversations with agents, as well as continue the existing ones - it's up to them. Keeping track of chat history is easy, as agents can scroll up to get a preview of all the exchanged messages in a conversation.

All of these functionalities are guaranteed _out of the box_, but this is just a tiny bit of what LiveChat offers. If you're interested in other default features, you can check them out [**here**](https://www.livechatinc.com/features/).

From a more tech perspective, LiveChat Platform provides:

- open messaging protocol with real-time and web APIs,
- rich messaging tools and chatbots,
- reporting and data extraction APIs,
- management and configuration APIs,
- monetization tools and Developer Console,
- Marketplace of apps and services.

# What LiveChat can be

We're constantly trying to come forward with the new ways customers could integrate with **LiveChat**. Certain business needs call for specific customization, whether it's creating an app or just tweaking the look & feel. Currently, you can extend **LiveChat** in three main areas:

- [LiveChat user interfaces](#extending-the-livechat-ui)
- [Platform APIs](#platform-apis)
- [Interacting with data](#interacting-with-data)

# Extending the LiveChat UI

<!-- [Extending user interfaces](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/building-apps-for-livechat/#extending-user-interfaces) -->

One of the paths is to extend user interfaces. We provide developers with tools to modify the Agent App, as well as the Chat Widget interface.

## Agent App

![LiveChat Tag Master](images/livechat-tag-master-app.jpg)

When integrating with the Agent App, developers can choose from a variety of options. They were designed to extend different locations of the Agent App making the whole application very flexible. To name them all, there are:

- Apps in the Details section (widgets)
- Apps in the Customer Details section (Customer Detail widgets)
- Chat Actions
- Fullscreen apps displayed in the main menu
- MessageBox

Those are the possible integration interfaces that developers can work with. You can always check out our [Marketplace](https://www.livechatinc.com/marketplace/) to see what integrations are available for purchase.

Each type of integration has its advantages, which in turn suggests use cases. The most common extensions are **apps in the Details section**, also known as widgets. They are quite versatile, which makes them usable in many cases. You could use them to display some statistics on your agents performance or to manage tags used by agents. Similar to **apps in Details** are the **apps in Customer Details**. There're perfect for displaying data needed at hand.

Speeding up the work can be easily achieved with **Chat Actions**, which are shortcuts to certain operations. Manual ticket creation takes a few steps, but with **Chat Actions** it's just a button click.

Web appplications can be displayed **fullscreen**, right in the Agent App. If you're planning on integrating your CRM with LiveChat, that might be the way to go.

There's also another area where developers can integrate their apps- it's the Message Box. This interface can be used for extensions related strongly to messages, which are being sent.
It could be used to send gifs or files from [Dropbox](https://www.livechatinc.com/marketplace/apps/dropbox/).

## Chat Widget

Just as there are ways to build upon the Agent App, there are also some to extend the Chat Widget. First of all, you could use [Chat Widget JavaScript API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/js-api/) to alter the look and behavior of the Chat Widget. If that's not enough, building a new Chat Widget from scratch is possible with the [Chat Widget Customer SDK](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/visitor-sdk/).

To make chatting more engaging, you could make use of [Chat Widget Moments](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/building-apps-for-livechat/#moments) (shown above) and [Rich Messages](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/rich-messages/).

# Platform APIs

Many applications built upon the LiveChat Platform need to use our API. For that reason, we make it accessible and let developers play with it.

There are two **messaging APIs**:

- [Agent Chat API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/beta-docs/agent-chat-api/)
- [Customer Chat API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/beta-docs/customer-chat-api/)

There's also the [Configuration API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/beta-docs/configuration-api/).

## Chat API

Together, the **Agent Chat API** and the **Customer Chat API** create the **Chat API**. It is a full set of methods to use either as an agent or as a customer. We divide it though, to make it more use-case-specific. The distinction is intuitive; when you want to join a chat as an agent, use the Agent Chat API. To interact as a customer, use the Customer Chat API.

These two sets of APIs are very versatile. The Agent Chat API lets you build your custom Agent App, as well as browser chat archives, or ban customers. With the use of the Customer Chat API, you can build a custom Chat Widget. Both APIs allow for interactions, such as joining a chat, posting messages, etc.

## Configuration API

The **Configuration API** is a service for storing license configurations. It allows for properties setup, webhooks management, and bot agents configuration.

# Interacting with data

One of the most extensively used section in the Agent App is [**Reports**](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/reporting-options-available-in-livechat/). We provide several types of reports, which help managers with the analysis. You can measure chat satisfaction and duration, keep track of agents' activity, or compare time periods to observe trends. Again, this is just a tiny bit of what's available in terms of reporting. Yet, we're aware that what we offer does not cover every single business case. This is where [**Reports API**](/data-reporting/reports-api/) comes into play. It serves as a sets of tools to create apps which interact on the server side. With this API, it's possible to design exactly what you need.

# Introduction

This documentation shows you how to embed a mobile chat window in an Android application.

# Installation

To get the project into your build, do the following:

## 1. Add the JitPack repository

[See the repository at JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#livechat/chat-window-android)

Add it to your root build.gradle at the end of `repositories`:

```js
allprojects {
     repositories {
         ...
         maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
     }
 }
```

## 2. Add the dependency

To add the dependency, use the following code:

```js
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.livechat:chat-window-android:v2.0.3'
}
```

<div class="clear"></div>

Your application will need a permission to use the Internet. Add the following line to your **AndroidManifest.xml**:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

<div class="clear"></div>

If you want to allow users to upload files from their external storage using the chat window, a permission is needed as well:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

# Setup

You can use this library in a couple of ways. To be able to use all features, we recommend you to add the chat window as a view, either by using a static method which adds the view to your Activity, or as an embedded view in your xml.

When **ChatWindowView** is initilized, you will get the events when a new message arrives.

First, let's configure the chat window.

## Configuration

The configuration is very simple - just use **ChatWindowConfiguration.java** constructor. Note that the licence number is mandatory.

```js
configuration = new ChatWindowConfiguration(
  "your_licence_number",
  "group_id",
  "Visitor name",
  "visitor@email.com",
  customParamsMap
);
```

## Chat Window View

There are two recommended ways to use the **ChatWindow**:

- Full screen ChatWindow added to the root of your Activity
- XML embedded ChatWindow to control the location and size

### Full Screen Window

All you need to do is to create, attach and initialize the chat window. For example:

```js
public void startFullScreenChat() {
    if (fullScreenChatWindow == null) {
        fullScreenChatWindow = ChatWindowView.createAndAttachChatWindowInstance(getActivity());
        fullScreenChatWindow.setUpWindow(configuration);
        fullScreenChatWindow.setUpListener(this);
        fullScreenChatWindow.initialize();
    }
    fullScreenChatWindow.showChatWindow();
}
```

### XML Embedded View

If you want to control the location and size of the **ChatWindowView**, you may want to add it to your app either by including a view in XML:

```xml
<com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowView
    android:id="@+id/embedded_chat_window"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="400dp"/>
```

<div class="clear"></div>

or by inflating the view directly:

```java
ChatWindowView chatWindowView = new ChatWindowView(MainActivity.this);
```

<div class="clear"></div>

and then initializing the **ChatWindow** with the full screen window approach:

```js
public void startEmmbeddedChat(View view) {
    if (!emmbeddedChatWindow.isInitialized()) {
        emmbeddedChatWindow.setUpWindow(configuration);
        emmbeddedChatWindow.setUpListener(this);
        emmbeddedChatWindow.initialize();
    }
    emmbeddedChatWindow.showChatWindow();
}
```

## Navigation

Depending on your use case you may want to hide the **ChatWindow** if a user hits the back button.
You can use our `onBackPressed()` function which hides the view if it's visible and returns `true`.
Add the following to your activity/fragment:

```js
@Override
public boolean onBackPressed() {
    return fullScreenChatWindow != null && fullScreenChatWindow.onBackPressed();
}
```

## File sharing

If you want the users to be able to send files, you need to set **ChatWindowEventsListener** on your **ChatWindowView** and allow the view to handle the activity result:

```js
@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (fullChatWindow != null) fullChatWindow.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}
```

## ChatWindowEventsListener

This listener allows you to:

- handle a case when a user wants to attach a file in the **ChatWindow**
- get notified if a new message has arrived in a chat (this comes in handy if you want to show a prompt for a user to read the new message)
- react to visibility changes (the users can hide the view on their own)

# Sample application

This sample app will display a chat trigger button. Once clicked, a chat window with your support team will be opened in the app.

You can refer to our sample `app` in the module. There are examples for three usage cases:

- Full screen Chat Window launched inside of an Activity
- Embedded Chat Window launched from a Fragment
- Starting ChatWindowActivity (with limited capabilities)

Possible use-cases include: adding a chat button to your “Contact us” screen or displaying a chat button all the time within the app. Read more about [providing in-app support](http://www.livechatinc.com/blog/2013/10/new-approach-to-in-app-support/) in mobile applications.

# Sample usage

There are two ways to open the chat window – by using an Activity or a Fragment.

## Activity

In order to open a chat window in a new Activity, you need to declare **ChatWindowActivity** in your manifest. Add the following line to **AndroidManifest.xml**, between `<application></application>` tags:

```xml
    <activity android:name="com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity" android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize" />
```

<div class="clear"></div>

Finally, add the following code to your application, in the place where you want to open the chat window (e.g. button listener). You need to provide a **Context** (your Activity or Application object), your LiveChat licence number (taken from the [tracking code](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/code)) and, optionally, the ID of a group:

```java
    Intent intent = new Intent(context, com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity.class);
    intent.putExtra(com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity.KEY_GROUP_ID, "your_group_id");
    intent.putExtra(com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity.KEY_LICENCE_NUMBER, "your_license_number");
    context.startActivity(intent);
```

<div class="clear"></div>

It’s also possibile to automatically login to the chat window by providing visitor’s name and email. You need to disable [pre-chat survey](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/pre-chat-survey) in the web application and add the following lines to the previous code:

```java
    intent.putExtra(com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity.KEY_VISITOR_NAME, "your_name");
    intent.putExtra(com.livechatinc.inappchat.ChatWindowActivity.KEY_VISITOR_EMAIL, "your_email");
```

## Fragment

In order to open chat window in a new Fragment, you need to add the following code to your application, in the place where you want to open the chat window (e.g. button listener). You also need to provide your LiveChat licence number and a group ID:

```java
    getFragmentManager()
       .beginTransaction()
       .replace(R.id.frame_layout, ChatWindowFragment.newInstance("your_license_number", "your_group_id"), "chat_fragment")
       .addToBackStack("chat_fragment")
       .commit();
```

<div class="clear"></div>

`ChatWindowFragment.newInstance()` method returns the chat window Fragment.

<div class="clear"></div>

It’s also possible to automatically login to the chat window by providing visitor’s name and email. You need to disable [pre-chat survey](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/pre-chat-survey) in the web application and use a different `newInstance()` method:

```java
    getFragmentManager()
       .beginTransaction()
       .replace(R.id.frame_layout, ChatWindowFragment.newInstance("your_license_number", "your_group_id", “visitor _name”, “visitor _email”), "chat_fragment")
       .addToBackStack("chat_fragment")
       .commit();
```

# Alternative usage

**Note: This option has limited capabilities.**

If you don't need the chat to work in the background nor to receive messages when the window is minimized, use Activity and Fragment chat window described above.

If you don't want the chat window to reload its content every time a device orientation changes, add this line to your Activity in the manifest:

```js
android: configChanges = "orientation|screenSize";
```

<div class="clear"></div>

The chat window will handle the orientation change by itself.

# Translation

You can change or translate error messages by defining your own string resources with the following IDs:

```xml
<string name="failed_to_load_chat">Couldn\'t load chat.</string>
<string name="cant_share_files">File sharing is not configured for this app</string>
```

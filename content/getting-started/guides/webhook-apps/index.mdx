# Introduction

This tutorial will help you build a LiveChat webhook integration. Follow this tutorial if you're developing a LiveChat integration that reacts to internal LiveChat events, such as a new incoming chat or queued visitor.

## Use cases

A typical use case for webhook integration is connecting LiveChat to an external CRM, marketing automation tools, or data analytics platforms. For instance, if you're integrating a marketing automation tool, you could add a new contact every time a LiveChat visitor starts a chat.

## Important notes

You'll need a basic knowledge about [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) and LiveChat [authorization protocol](/getting-started/authorization/) (OAuth2.0).

This tutorial won't be helpful for building integrations that pull data on demand (not in reaction to some LiveChat event). If you just want to pull LiveChat reports on user request, you'd rather just use [Data & Reporting APIs](/data-reporting/).

# Basic tutorial

## 1. Sign in to Developer Console

You'll need a Developer Account. [Sign up](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/) to Developer Console and get access to all Platform Developer Tools.

## 2. Create new app

![LiveChat Developer Console](./images/livechat-developers-console-create-app.png)

## 3. Add Settings Page

Go to Building Blocks and create a new Agent App Widget with `App Settings` placement. This widget will be displayed as a settings page for your app.

![Create new Settings widget](./images/livechat-developers-console-create-widget.png)

## 4. Add Authorization Block

Go back to Building Blocks section and create a new `Server-side app` Authorization Block. Save the highlighted `Client ID` &ndash; you'll need it later!

## 5. Create a settings page

Settings page is the place where you can:

- ask users to connect their accounts with your OAuth2.0 provider,
- display configuration options,
- inform users about additional installation steps (if there are any).

If you need to access LiveChat user data, we recommend using [Sign in with LiveChat SDK](/getting-started/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat/).

### Sample settings page scenario

For instance if you're building an integration that binds LiveChat data with an external service, you should create a settings page that:

1. Imports [Sign in with LiveChat SDK](/getting-started/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat/).
2. Imports your sign in form or other authorization flow (e.g. "Connect with..." button).
3. Binds both informations and stores new user in your database.
4. Displays a confirmation screen when the integration is up and running.

The settings page will appear right after LiveChat user installs your app in the Marketplace.

## 6. Register the webhooks

Once you have LiveChat credentials, you can register your webhooks with Platform APIs. There are two APIs you can use to manage webhooks:

- [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks)
- [Configuration API v2](/management/configuration-api-v2/#create-a-new-webhook/) (deprecated)

### Seting up webhooks for development

For development purposes we recommend setting your webhooks from within LiveChat Agent App.

Go to **Settings > Integrations > [Webhooks](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/webhooks)** and set up your webhook URLs

![LiveChat Webhooks](./images/livechat-platform-webhooks-settings.png)

Each webhook consists of the following properties:

- **Event** – determines when the webhook is sent to your web server.
- **Data type** – includes additional information in the webhook.
- **Target URL** – address of your web server the webhook will be sent to.

# Webhooks reference

Please see the following documents for reference on how to manage webhooks:

- To [set up](/management/configuration-api/#methods-2) webhooks 
- To learn the [webhooks format](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks)

## Webhooks v2 Reference (deprecated)

<Warning>

**Note: This reference is deprecated**. The version 3.x of Platform APIs introduce new webhook interfaces. We highly recommend migrating out of the deprecated system. The new webhooks service has much more functionality and provides you with much more control over the data. Please note that the new Platform APIs also provide a **RTM (websocket) transport**.

</Warning>

LiveChat can send notifications when some particular action is performed. Such a notification is called a **webhook** – it’s just a simple HTTP request that LiveChat sends to your server when a particular event occurs. Check the basic auth example below.

### HTTP Basic Auth

For security reasons it's recommended to use HTTP basic authentication. Credentials should be passed in this format: `https://user:password@www.my-website.com`. We recommend using https:// in webhook url.

<CodeSample path={'.htaccess'}>

```shell
AuthType Basic
AuthName "My Protected Area"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```

</CodeSample>

<CodeSample path={'.htpasswd'}>

```
livechat:$apr1$G9iXatUK$gPJLrKQsoWWkFCY/SXO/H.
```

</CodeSample>

Example webhook url

<CodeResponse>

```
https://livechat:password@www.my-website.com
```

</CodeResponse>

### Webhook format

Each webhook is a HTTP POST request made to the URL that you provide in the web app. The request's POST body contains webhook information in JSON format.

<CodeResponse title={"Sample webhook payload"}>

```json
{
  "event_type": "chat_started",
  "token": "27f41c8da685c81a890f9e5f8ce48387",
  "license_id": "1025707"
}
```

</CodeResponse>

Each webhook contains the following properties:

- `event_type` – tells you the event that triggered the webhook. Possible values: `chat_started`, `chat_ended`, `visitor_queued`.
- `token` and `license_id` – your authentication credentials that let you call LiveChat’s Configuration API v2 methods. You won’t need to use them unless you want to make a call to LiveChat’s API right when you receive a webhook. In that case, you just need to pass these `token` and `license_id` credentials in your API call.
- additional information – please read the [Webhook data types](#webhook-data-types) section.

When your server receives a webhook from LiveChat, it should respond with `HTTP 200` response. Otherwise, LiveChat will retry sending the webhook to your service for a number of times unless it receives the correct `HTTP 200` response.

Note: LiveChat webhooks are sent with `Content-Type: application/json` header, so please make sure that your service can handle such requests.

Note: `chat_changed` event type is sent only when the tag list for a particular chat was changed, no matter if the chat is pending or not.

### Webhook data types

<CodeResponse title={"Example webhook payload"}>

```json
{
  "event_type": "chat_started",
  "token": "27f41c8da685c81a890f9e5f8ce48387",
  "license_id": "1025707",
  "visitor": {
    "id": "S1354547427.0c151b0e1b",
    "name": "John",
    "email": "john.smith@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

</CodeResponse>

In some cases, you may want to get some additional information when the particular event occurs.

For example, when the chat starts, you may want to know the exact chat start time along with the visitor's name and e-mail provided in the pre-chat survey. To get this information, you can add some **data types** that will be sent to your webserver along with each webhook.

| Event type                | Supported data types                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `visitor_queued`          | `visitor`                            |
| `chat_started`            | `chat`, `visitor`, `pre_chat_survey` |
| `chat_ended`              | `chat`, `visitor`, `pre_chat_survey` |
| `chat_changed`            | `chat`, `visitor`                    |
| `ticket_created`          | `ticket`                             |
| `canned_response_changed` | `canned_response`                    |

### Example apps

Here are some ideas for using LiveChat webhooks:

- display a warning message on your internal statusboard when your website visitors start queueing before the chat,
- save each chat transcript in the external system,
- read additional information about your visitors from your database and send it back to the LiveChat app.

#### Queued visitors notifier

Let’s say you want to be notified with a sound on your internal company statusboard every time a visitor is queued before the chat.

Upload an example script (displayed in the right column) to your web server and set up a webhook to send `visitor_queued` event to this script.

<CodeSample>

```php
<?php

// read the webhook sent by LiveChat
$data = file_get_contents('php://input');
$data = json_decode($data);

// make sure the "visitor_queued" event occured
if ($data->event_type === 'visitor_queued')
{
    // BAM! Play a sound on your internal statusboard
    // $Statusboard->play();
}
```

</CodeSample>

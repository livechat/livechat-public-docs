## Getting started

#### What's the easiest way to authorize calls to the LiveChat API? 
For fast & easy authorization, we recommend [**Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**](/getting-started/authorization/#personal-access-tokens). They're a way to go if you want to authorize private apps or speed up the development process.

#### Can I use the same access token to make calls to all APIs?
No. Making calls to the Customer Chat API requires you to use a different token than for all other APIs. Read about [**Agent authorization flows**](/getting-started/authorization/#agent-authorization-flows)
and [**Customer authorization flows**](/getting-started/authorization/#customer-authorization-flow).

## Personal Access Tokens

#### How can I get a Personal Access Token?
Log in to <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Developer Console**</a> with your LiveChat login and password. Go to **Tools > Personal Access Tokens** and click **Create new token +**, or use an existing token if you have one.

#### Authorizing requests with a Personal Access Token doesn't work.
1. Remember, PATs use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Basic_authentication_scheme/" target="_blank">**Basic authentication scheme**</a>. Make sure you're not using something else, for example **Bearer**.
2. Ensure you're not using a PAT to authorize a call to the Customer Chat API. If that's what you want to achieve, see [**How can I make calls to the Customer Chat API?**](#how-can-i-make-calls-to-the-customer-chat-api)
3. Check if your PAT is valid, complete, and has all necessary scopes. You can use our <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/tools/token-debugger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Token Debugger**</a>.  


## Customer authorization 

#### How can I make calls to the Customer Chat API?
You need to create a customer. Then, you'll use the access token of this customer to authorize your calls to the Customer Chat API. To create a customer, send a request described in [**Creating new customer**](/getting-started/authorization/#creating-new-customer).

#### The access token of my customer has expired. Do I need to create a new customer?
You don't have to create a new customer. You can request a new access token for the customer of a specific `entity_id`. `entity_id` is returned in the response when creating a customer.
To get a new access token for your customer, send the following request:

```
curl 'https://accounts.livechatinc.com/customer/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID_OF_YOUR_APP>",
  "response_type": "token",
  "redirect_uri": "<URI_YOU_DEFINED_IN_DEVELOPER_CONSOLE>",
  "entity_id": "<ENTITY_ID_OF_YOUR_CUSTOMER>"
}'
```

It's the same request as the one to [**create a new customer**](/getting-started/authorization/#creating-new-customer). The only difference it that it has an additional parameter, `entity_id`.


## Errors

#### I get the "Invalid access token" error.
1. Perhaps, you're trying to authorize your call to the **Customer Chat API** with an access token valid for the **Agent Chat API** & **Configuration API**, or the other way round.

    - [**Get a token for Agent Chat and Configuration APIs**](/getting-started/authorization/#agent-authorization-flows)
    - [**Get a token for Customer Chat API**](/getting-started/authorization/#customer-authorization-flow)

2. Check if you copy-pasted the token correctly.
3. Check if your access token contains `%3A`. If it does, change it to `:` (a colon). 
4. If you still can't solve the problem, try acquiring a new token. You can follow along [**our guide**](/getting-started/guides/messaging-apis-in-practice/), which explains how to make a call to the **Agent Chat API v3.1** and presents the token acquisition in detail.
5. To check if your token is valid, complete, and has all necessary scopes, you can use our <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/tools/token-debugger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Token Debugger**</a>. You can't use this tool to check an access token of a customer.


#### I get the "Invalid message" error.
1. Make sure the body of your request is in the **JSON** format. 
2. Make sure you've got all the commas, quotation marks, and brackets correct.
3. Compare the payload of your request with the corresponding sample request in the documentation. 


#### I get the "The client is not authorized to request a token using this method" error.
You may get this error when trying to exchange an expired `code` for `token` in the OAuth flow. It's because `code` is only valid for a few minutes after the creation. What's more, it can be exchanged for an access or refresh token **only once**.

This document is the record of all the changes in [the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) starting from **version 3.0**. What you **won't find** here is the list of changes between versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the Configuration API.

Switching from v2.0 to v3.0 was more than an upgrade - it was rather a migration. That's why some parts of the configuration, such as managing canned responses or greetings, can be done only via the [Configuration API v2](/management/configuration-api/v2.0/), while other, like managing webhooks or properties, via [the Configuration API v3](/management/configuration-api/).

Since the migration is still ongoing, different parts will be successively moved from **the Configuration API v2.0** to **v3.x**.

This document is the record of all the changes in [the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) starting from **version 3.0**. What you won't find here is the list of changes between versions 3 and 2 of the Configuration API.

Switching from v2.0 to v3.0 was more than an upgrade - it was rather a migration. That's why some parts of the configuration, such as managing canned responses or greetings, can be done only via the [Configuration API v2](/docs/management/configuration-api-v2/), while other, like managing webhooks or properties, via [the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) v3.

Since the migration is still ongoing, different parts will be successively moved from **the Configuration API v2** to **v3**.

## [v3.2] - Developer Preview

### Added

- There's a new field, `license_id`, in all [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#webhooks).
- From now on, it's possible to define properties in [2 new locations](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#property-locations): `license` and `group`.
- There are 4 new methods: [**Set License Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#set-license-properties), [**Get License Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#get-license-properties), [**Set Group Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#set-group-properties), [**Get Group Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#get-group-properties).
- There's new webhook: [`follow_up_requested`](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#follow_up_requested).

## [v3.1] - 2019-09-17

### Changed

- The `data` field in webhooks was renamed to `payload`.

# Introduction

LiveChat Platform provides multiple APIs for managing resources.

# Configuration API

## Use cases

The [**Configuration API**](/management/configuration-api/) allows for:

- storing license configurations
- creating chat, thread, and event [properties](/management/configuration-api/#properties)
- managing [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks), for example registering and unregistering
- managing [Bots](/management/configuration-api/#bots), for example creating and removing

In the near future, it will allow for groups configuration. For now, refer to [**Configuration API v2**](/management/configuration-api/v2.0/#groups) to manage groups properties.

## Properties

Properties are **key-value storages**. They can be set within a chat, a thread, or an event. You can create properties within a license and configure them using the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/). It's possible to configure the property [type](../management/configuration-api/#property-types), [location](../management/configuration-api/#property-locations), and [domain](../management/configuration-api/#property-domain).

Refer to the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) document to read more about the [property format](/management/configuration-api/#properties) and available [endpoints](/management/configuration-api/#methods-1).

## Webhooks

In general, actions invoked by the use of Messaging APIs result in events. You can be notified about those events with **webhooks**. LiveChat provides a number of webhooks, which you can register and manage via the [Configuration API](../management/configuration-api/#webhooks).
We distinguish **global webhooks** and **bot-specific webhooks**. Once **global webhooks** are set up, you will always receive them. **Bot-specific** webhooks are strongly coupled with the bot's status (`accepting chats`, `not accepting chats`, `offline`). If the bot is offline, webhooks won't be received.
Webhook equivalents in the websocket transport (RTM API) are **pushes**.

## Bots

Bots are similar to their human counterparts. They can join chats and post messages, but they also have a special feature: you can attach [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks) to them.

Bots are created and managed via the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#bots). As standard agents, Bots can use Agent Chat API by the web API or websocket connection ([see the difference](#rtm-api-vs-web-api)).

Bots are authorized with the use of the Agent's token. Using Bots requires sending the `X-Author-Id` header for the [Web API Reference](messaging/agent-chat-api/#methods) and the `author_id` property for the websocket connection.
They can listen for incoming webhooks (or [pushes](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#pushes)) and react to them.

## New Configuration APIs

Configuration API is a service for storing configuration of license. It allows you to set up custom properties, bot agents and webhooks. You'll be using this API together with [Messaging APIs](../messaging/).

## Old Configuration APIs

Use Configuration API v2 for handling agents, goals and other product related features.

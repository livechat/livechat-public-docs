# Introduction

LiveChat Platform limits the amount of resources that can be created based on billing plan.

## Limits

| Limited resource              | Starter | Team | Business | Enterprise |
|-------------------------------|---------|------|----------|------------|
| Tracked visitors              | 400     | 400  | 400      | 400        |
| Groups                        | 1       | 20   | 40       | 80         |
| Groups assigned to an agent   | 1       | 10   | 20       | 40         |
| Chat queue                    | 10      | 50   | 100      | 100        |

| Chat archives history         | 2m      | 1y   | 2y       | unlimited  |
| Number of banned visitors     | 50      | 200  | 400      | 400        |

There is new type of error `limit_reached` that will be returned by APIs when trying to create resources over the limit.

Affected methods are:

*Agent API*

- [List Archives](../../messaging/agent-chat-api/#list-archives)
- [Ban Customer](../../messaging/agent-chat-api/#ban-customer)

*Configuration API*

_v3_

- [Create Group](../configuration-api/#create-group)
- [Update Group](../configuration-api/#update-group)
- [Create Agent](../configuration-api/#create-agent)
- [Update Agent](../configuration-api/#update-agent)

_v2_

- [/agents](../configuration-api/v2.0/#agents)
- [/groups](../configuration-api/v2.0/#groups)

## Downgrading

When downgrading to the lower plan, resources usage is validated against new plan limits and might result in an error. Returned error message will list all resources that must be decreased in order to perform downgrade.

# Introduction

LiveChat Platform lets you extract data from all the [Reports](https://www.livechatinc.com/help/reporting-options-available-in-livechat/) available in LiveChat. You can use this data to create your own reports, build custom dashboards or set up custom email reporting.

# Use cases

There are a number of ways to leverage the Reports API:

- export data to Excel ([see blogpost](https://developers.livechatinc.com/blog/how-to-get-livechat-api-data-with-microsoft-excel-or-power-bi/)) or 3rd-party analytics and BI tools,
- create dashboards for teams ([like this one](https://dashboard.livechatinc.com/)),
- set up alerting and notifications for specific metrics,
- schedule custom email reporting.

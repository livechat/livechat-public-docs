# Introduction

The LiveChat Billing API allows you to charge for your apps in the LiveChat Marketplace. Therefore, you can offer paid applications to over 28,000 LiveChat customers.

The Billing API is a collective name for a subset of smaller APIs used for specific purposes (see the [APIs section](#2-apis) below for details).

## Overview

### Payment types

The Billing API supports the following payment types:

- direct charges (one-time charges)
- subscriptions
- per-usage payments (coming soon)

### Additional options

It also handles a set of features to facilitate the payment and accounting processes:

- credit card processing
- invoices - coming soon

<aside class="note">
  The customers can use their existing credit card from their LiveChat account;
  there’s no need to re-renter the card details.

# Getting started

## Example apps

### Billing Demo app

A sample front-end app that implements Billing API to offer in-app payments.

It's available on GitHub: [https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo](https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo)

### Agent App Widget

A sample LiveChat [Agent App Widget](/extending-ui/extending-agent-app/agent-app-sdk/) that offers in-app payment using Billing API.

It's available on GitHub: [https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo-agent-app-extension](https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo-agent-app-extension)

# User guide

## 1. Authorization

The Billing API is based on the [LiveChat OAuth](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/) authorization flow. All endpoints require access tokens, and some endpoints are limited by scope or client ID.

## 2. APIs

### 2.1. Direct Charges

The Direct Charges API allows you to collect one-time fees.

#### Use cases:

- Collecting a single charge for an application in the Marketplace
- Collecting in-app micropayments
- Charging for additional features in the apps

### 2.2. Ledger

The Ledger API lets you manage the financial activity and balance. In other words, it will show you the purchase history and your earnings.

#### Use cases:

- Checking the balance
- Checking the billing history

### 2.3. Recurrent Charges

The Recurrent Charges API handles periodic payments. For example, you can offer an app that costs \$10 per month.

#### Use cases:

- Viewing the subscriptions
- Updating the subscriptions

# Direct charges

The Direct Charges API is a tool to collect one-time fees (also called "direct charges").

## Statuses

There are six possible direct charge statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending`   | the charge has been created and is awaiting user interaction |
| `accepted`  | the charge has been accepted by the user                     |
| `declined`  | the charge has been declined by the user                     |
| `processed` | the charge is being processed by a payment gateway           |
| `failed`    | the charge could not be collected                            |
| `success`   | the charge has been collected                                |

## Flows

There are three possible direct charge flows:

- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `failed`
- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `success`
- `pending` -> `declined`

## Usage

- Create a charge for a user (`POST /v1/direct_charge`) and redirect them to the `confirmation_url`.
- After the user confirms or declines the charge, they will be redirected to `return_url` with charge `id` passed as a URL param.
- Based on `id`, you can check charge status (`GET /v1/direct_charge/:ID`). If it is `accepted`, you must activate the charge (`PUT /v1/direct_charge/:ID/activate`).
- After a while, our payment gateway will try to charge the user and it will automatically change the charge status to `success` or `failed`.

## Direct charge object

Here's the structure of a single direct charge object.

Parameters description:

- `price` - an integer defined in cents. Example: to charge \$99, set the `price` to 9900
- `commission_percent` - a percentage fee deducted by LiveChat from the application price
- `per_account` - the app is sold in the **pay per account** model; the **app price** is multiplied by the number of accounts within the organization
(`price` x `quantity`)

## Scopes

Direct Charges API requires `billing_manage` scope for all endpoints.

If you want to use this API, you must create an app in Developers Console and check **"offer in-app payments"** scope in the app settings. After successful authorization (by using Sign in with LiveChat), you will get an access token with `billing_manage` scope.

## Endpoints

Base URL: `https://billing.livechatinc.com`

- `POST /v1/direct_charge` - create a new charge. Required fields: `name`, `price`, `quantity`, `return_url`. Optional fields: `per_account`, `test`
- `GET /v1/direct_charge/:ID` - get an existing charge.
- `GET /v1/direct_charge` - create a paginated charges list (20 items per page) ordered by the creation date. Optional fields: `page`, `status` (for filtering by status. Returns: `{"result:[OBJECT_1, ... , OBJECT_N]"}`).
- `PUT /v1/direct_charge/:ID/activate` - activate a charge (the payment gateway starts processing it).

# Ledger

The Ledger API handles the financial activity and balance.

## Entry object types

- `collection` - the amount has beed added
- `refund` - the amount has been deducted
- `withdrawal` - the amount has been paid off

## Scopes

Ledger API requires `ledger_read` scope for all endpoints.

If you want to use this API, you must create an app in Developers Console and check **"read developer’s financial activity and balance"** scope in the app settings. After successful authorization (by using Sign in with LiveChat), you will get an access token with `ledger_read` scope.

## Endpoints

Base URL: `https://billing.livechatinc.com`

- `GET /v1/ledger` - returns the current ledger. It lists up to 20 entries, use `?page=X` for pagination. Required format: `{result: [LEDGER ENTRY 1, LEDGER ENTRY 2, ...]}`,
- `GET /v1/ledger/balance` - returns the current ledger balance in cents. Format: `{"balance": 10}`

# Recurrent charges

The Recurrent Charges API handles periodic payments. Once the payment is set up, a customer will be charged every month.

## Statuses

There are six possible recurrent charge statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`   | the charge has been created and is awaiting merchant interaction |
| `accepted`  | the charge has been accepted by the merchant                     |
| `declined`  | the charge has been declined by the merchant                     |
| `active`    | the charge is being processed by a payment gateway               |
| `frozen`    | the charge could not be collected                                |
| `cancelled` | the charge has been cancelled                                    |

## Flows

There are three possible recurrent charge flows:

- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `active` -> `cancelled`
- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `active` -> `frozen`
- `pending` -> `declined`

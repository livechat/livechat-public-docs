# About LiveChat Platform

**LiveChat** is an online customer service software with live support, help desk and web analytics capabilities. It's used by more than {{NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS}} companies in over 150 countries. **LiveChat Platform** is an ecosystem for developers that grew around LiveChat products over the years.

# Introduction

LiveChat Customer JS SDK is a set of tools to build a custom chat widget. It allows you to manage multiple chats via LiveChat as a
customer using JavaScript.

## Is it for me?

If you need to customize the LiveChat widget, using LiveChat Customer JS SDK is
one of the options to do this. If you need a fully custom solution and you feel
brave, dive into LiveChat Customer JS SDK: we provide [methods](#methods) and
[events](#events) for deep integration with the LiveChat environment.

Keep in mind, however, that interacting with this API requires **some
development skills**.

## About LiveChat Customer JS SDK

We provide an asynchronous API, where most methods interacting with a server
return **promises**. To get the promise's fulfillment result, subscribe your handler to
the promise's
[`then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)
method. You can also subscribe to the emitted events with `on` and `off` methods.

  </a>{" "}
  to learn more.
</div>

We authenticate your sessions by using
[customer-auth package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/customer-auth)
and expose the created `auth` object on the returned SDK's instance. In general,
you don't have to worry about it nor use the exposed object, but if you need to
get the authentication token you can get it through the SDK like this:

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK.auth.getToken().then(token => console.log(token));
```

</CodeSample>

## Examples

We have prepared a sample chat widget implementation to present the features of LiveChat Customer JS SDK:

- [Sample widget at CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rm3prxw88n)

# How to start

This tutorial will help you get started with using LiveChat Customer JS SDK.

## Create an application

First, you need to create an application in the
[Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) (select the _Web app (frontend,
eg. JavaScript)_ type).

## Install Customer JS SDK

You can use LiveChat Customer JS SDK in two different ways:

### Using npm

<CodeSample>

```
npm install --save @livechat/customer-sdk
```

</CodeSample>

Now, you can import SDK in your code:

<CodeSample>

```
import * as CustomerSDK from '@livechat/customer-sdk'
```

</CodeSample>

or with a node-style `require` call:

<CodeSample>

```
const CustomerSDK = require('@livechat/customer-sdk')
```

</CodeSample>

### Using script tag - UMD module hosted on unpkg's CDN

<CodeSample>

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@livechat/customer-sdk"></script>
```

</CodeSample>

If you just want to look around and play with the SDK, check out our
[sample chat widget implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/rm3prxw88n).

<div class="callout type-warning">
  For the time being you need to register your application in the{" "}
  <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console" target="_blank">
    Developers Console
  </a>{" "}
  as a "Web app (frontend, eg. JavaScript)" type. Then, you have to pass the
  configured <code>redirectUri</code> to the <code>init</code>, along with the
  regular required properties (<code>license</code> and <code>clientId</code>).
</div>

## Use the API

Now run the `init` function with the configuration, replacing `LICENSE_NUMBER`
with your LiveChat license number. The function will return the customerSDK
instance:

<CodeSample>

```js
const customerSDK = CustomerSDK.init({
  license: LICENSE_NUMBER,
  clientId: CLIENT_ID
});
```

</CodeSample>

With `customerSDK`, you can attach [events](#events):

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK.on("new_event", newEvent => {
  console.log(newEvent);
});
```

</CodeSample>

or execute [methods](#methods):

<CodeSample>

```js
const chatId = "OU0V0P0OWT";
customerSDK
  .sendEvent(chatId, {
    type: "message",
    text: "Hi!"
  })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

</CodeSample>

### Using the API in React Native

If you want to use LiveChat Customer SDK in React Native, keep in mind that we
use cookies to authenticate your sessions, so we need some sort of browser
environment for that. We've prepared a special wrapper for you to use in React
Native, which opens a WebView component to get an authentication token. All you
have to do is to import it from our authentication package (no need to install
it - the SDK depends on it, so you have it already) and mount it in your React
Native application:

<CodeSample>

```js
import { AuthWebView } from "@livechat/customer-auth";
import { init } from "@livechat/customer-sdk";

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const customerSDK = init({
      license: LICENSE_NUMBER,
      clientId: CLIENT_ID,
      redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI
    });
    // you can start using customerSDK from now
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <AuthWebView />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

</CodeSample>

# Key Concepts

The LiveChat system is based on four basic types of entities - users, chats, events and
threads.

- chats consist of threads and threads consist of events
- threads are parts of chats,
- users can add events to chats, which then are automatically added to threads
- users can participate in many chats at the same time

Threads are a vital part of LiveChat architecture. They provide
continuous chat experience (i.e. they never end and you can always add to
them) and they group events in smaller logical chunks, e.g. for reporting and
caching purposes. However, threads tend to complicate handling
various operations like loading more history events. The good part is that you don't
have to worry about them most of the time and this SDK is doing the heavy lifting
behind the scenes for you. You will get notified about threads'
metadata only if you explicitly ask for it - most SDK methods expect only chat
IDs.

## User

<CodeSample>

```js
{
	id: 'ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9',
	type: 'agent',
	name: 'Jane Doe',
	avatar: 'https://livechat-static.com/assets/images/livechat_logo.ae4271fe1a0a2db838dcf075388ee844.png',
}
```

</CodeSample>

## Chat

<CodeSample>

```js
{
	id: 'OU0V0P0OWT',
	users: [{
		id: 'ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9',
		// ... more user properties
	}],
	lastSeenTimestamps: {
		'ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9': 1503062591000, // might be null
	},
	threads: ['OU0V0U3IMN'],
}
```

</CodeSample>

## Event

<CodeSample>

```js
{
	type: 'message',
	text: 'hi!',
    author: 'ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9', // assigned by server
	id: 'OU0V0U3IMN_1', // assigned by server
    timestamp: 1503062591000, // assigned by server
    customnId: '814.3316641404942', // optional
    thread: 'OU0V4R0OXP',
	properties: {},
}
```

</CodeSample>

## Threads

<CodeSample>

```js
{
	id: 'OU0V0U3IMN',
	active: true,
	order: 3,
	users: ['ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9'],
	lastSeenTimestamps: {
		'ed9d4095-45d6-428d-5093-f8ec7f1f81b9': 1503062591000, // might be null
	},
	events: [ /* events */ ],
}
```

</CodeSample>

## Methods

### closeThread

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK
  .closeThread("ON0X0R0L67")
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

</CodeSample>

Arguments:

| arguments | type   | description                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| chat      | string | Chat's id in which thread should get closed |

Returned value:

| shape   | type    |
| ------- | ------- |
| success | boolean |

### destroy

This method clears any held resources, removes all listeners and
disconnects from the network. After using this method you won't be able to use
the destroyed SDK's instance.

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK.destroy();
```

</CodeSample>

### disconnect

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK.disconnect();
```

</CodeSample>

### getChatHistory

This method facilitates loading more history events. You need to
get access to the `history` object for certain chat by calling this method. The
returned `history` object has only one method, `next`, which gives you a promise
of `{ done, value }` pair.

- `done` - indicates if there is anything more to load
- `value` - it's an array of loaded events

You can keep calling `history.next()` multiple times to load more and more
history events (useful for infinite scroll feature). Keep in mind, though,
that you generally shouldn't call `next` while the history is being loaded - we
queue those requests so the previous one must resolve before we proceed with the
next one.

Such structure like our `history` object is called an **async iterator**.

<CodeSample>

```js
let wholeChatHistoryLoaded = false;

const history = customerSDK.getChatHistory("OU0V0P0OWT");

history.next().then(result => {
  if (result.done) {
    wholeChatHistoryLoaded = true;
  }

  const events = result.value;
  console.log(events);
});
```

</CodeSample>

| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| chat      | string | Chat's id for which history object should be returned |

### getChatsSummary

customerSDK
  .getChatsSummary({
    offset: 0,
    limit: 10
  })
  .then(({ chatsSummary, totalChats }) => {

|           | attachToLastThread | boolean | optional              |

### sendFile

This method is a little bit special - it returns regular `then`/`catch` methods
of a Promise **and** a `cancel` method which you can use to abort the upload of
the file. It also lets you pass `onProgress` callback function. Keep in mind
that the maximum accepted file size is 10 MB.

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK
  .sendFile(
    "ON0X0R0L67",
    {
      file,
      customId // optional
    },
    {
      onProgress: progress => console.log(`upload progress: ${progress}`)
    }
  )
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.url);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

</CodeSample>

Arguments:

| arguments | shape      | type     | description                                                                   |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

|           | customId   | string   | Optional customId for the event                                               |
| spec      |            |          |                                                                               |
|           | onProgress | function | This callback function will receive a progress value - number between 0 and 1 |

Returned value:

| shape | type   |
| ----- | ------ |
| url   | string |

In React Native instead of passing a blob you need to pass an object of
[such shape](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/56fef9b6225ffc1ba87f784660eebe842866c57d/Libraries/Network/FormData.js#L34-L38):

<CodeSample>

```js
const file = {
  uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
  type: "image/jpeg", // optional
  name: "photo.jpg" // optional
};
```

</CodeSample>

### sendPostback

<CodeSample>

```js
customerSDK
  .sendPostback("ON0X0R0L67", "OS0C0W0Z1B", "OS0C0W0Z1B01", {
    id: "OS0C0W0Z1B01002",
    toggled: true

### \$\$observable

You can consume all emitted events as a stream with
[most](https://github.com/mostjs/core) of stream libraries like in example
[RxJS](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs). We provide an interop point for this,
so you can easily convert our SDK to a stream like this:

<CodeSample>

```js
import Rx from "@reactivex/rxjs";

Rx.Observable.from(visitorSDK).subscribe(([eventName, eventData]) => {
  console.log(eventName, eventData);
});
```

</CodeSample>

## Events

You can listen for emitted events by subscribing to them (using
[on method](#on)) with your custom JavaScript function. For example, your
function can be executed every time a message has been received.

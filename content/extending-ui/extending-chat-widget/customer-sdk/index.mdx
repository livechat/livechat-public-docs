# Introduction

**LiveChat Customer SDK** is a set of tools that helps you build a custom chat widget. Under the hood, it makes use of the [LiveChat Customer Chat API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/messaging/customer-chat-api/). Customer SDK lets you communicate with LiveChat services directly from the browser environment using JavaScript without the need to develop your backend.

## Is it for me?

If you need to customize the LiveChat Widget, using LiveChat Customer SDK is
one of the options to do this. If you need a fully customizable solution and you feel
brave, dive into LiveChat Customer SDK. We provide [methods](#methods) and
[events](#events) for deep integration with the LiveChat environment.

Keep in mind that interacting with this API requires **some development skills**.

Customer SDK allows you to create frontend apps, so if you're looking for server-side solutions, you should explore the [LiveChat Customer Chat API](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/messaging/customer-chat-api/) instead.
If you want to dive deeper into the LiveChat Platform, you might find the [Platform Overview](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/getting-started/) article handy.

## About LiveChat Customer SDK

We provide an asynchronous API. Most methods return a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). You can subscribe to the emitted events with the `on` and `off` methods.
Not familiar with promises? Read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">this article</a> to learn more.

We authenticate your sessions with the use of
[customer-auth package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/customer-auth)
and expose the created `auth` object to the returned SDK instance. In general,
you don't have to worry about it or use the exposed object. If you need to
get the authentication token, you can get it through the SDK like this:

```js
customerSDK.auth.getToken().then(token => {
  console.log(token)
})
```

## Questions

If you have any questions, you can start a chat with our [24/7 Support](https://direct.lc.chat/1520/125).

# How to start

This tutorial is here to help you get started with LiveChat Customer SDK.

## Create an application

First, you need to create an application in
[Developer Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) (select the _Web app (frontend,
e.g. JavaScript)_ type). Then, you will have to give it the access to the `customers:own` scope and the correct URI to the `Redirect URI whitelist`.

## Install Customer SDK

You can use the LiveChat Customer SDK in two different ways:

### Using npm

`npm install --save @livechat/customer-sdk`

Import the SDK in your code:

`import * as CustomerSDK from '@livechat/customer-sdk'`

Or use the node-style `require` call:

`const CustomerSDK = require('@livechat/customer-sdk')`

### Using a script tag - UMD module hosted on unpkg's CDN

`<script src="https://unpkg.com/@livechat/customer-sdk@2.0.0"></script>`

If you just want to look around and play with the SDK, check out our
[sample chat widget implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/rm3prxw88n).

For the time being you need to register your application in the <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console" target="_blank">Developers Console</a>
as a "Web app (frontend, eg. JavaScript)" type. Then, you have to pass the configured `redirectUri` to the `init`, along with the regular required properties (`licenseId` and `clientId`).

## Using the API

To use the API you will first need to create an instance using the `init` function.
You will need to provide your licenseId and clientId when creating a Customer SDK instance.

Other optional configuration parameters are also available:

| parameters           | type               | default | description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| licenseId            | number             |         | Your license number, you receive this value when creating a new livechat account.                                                                                             |
| clientId             | string             |         | Your client id, you receive this value when you register your application in the LiveChat developer console.                                                                  |
| autoConnect          | boolean            | true    | Optional; should the library try to reconnect on it's own.                                                                                                                    |
| groupId              | number             | 0       | Optional; the id of the group you wish to connect to.                                                                                                                         |
| region               | 'dal' \| 'fra'     | 'dal'   | Optional; the server region your license is at.                                                                                                                               |
| redirectUri          | string             |         | Optional; should only be used inside ReactNative, this is the URI which your webview is redirected to after authorization.                                                    |
| customerDataProvider | () => CustomerData |         | Optional; should only be used if you need to send customer data during login. In general, [`updateCustomer()`](#updateCustomer) should be prefered for sending customer data. |

CustomerData:

| parameters    | type   | description      |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| name          | string | Optional         |
| email         | string | Optional         |
| sessionFields | object | Key: value pairs |

The `init` function will return a Customer SDK instance:

```js
const customerSDK = CustomerSDK.init({
  licenseId: LICENSE_ID,
  clientId: CLIENT_ID,
})
```

With `customerSDK`, you can attach [events](#events):

```js
customerSDK.on('new_event', newEvent => {
  console.log(newEvent)
})
```

Or execute [methods](#methods):

```js
const chatId = 'OU0V0P0OWT'
customerSDK
  .sendEvent({
    chatId,
    event: {
      type: 'message',
      text: 'Hi!',
    },
  })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

### Using the API in React Native

If you want to use LiveChat Customer SDK in React Native, keep in mind that we
use cookies to authenticate your sessions, so we need some sort of browser
environment for that. We've prepared a special wrapper for you to use in React
Native. It opens a WebView component to get an authentication token. All you
have to do is import it from our authentication package (no need to install
it - the SDK depends on it, so you already have it) and mount it in your React
Native application:

```js
import { AuthWebView } from '@livechat/customer-auth'
import { init } from '@livechat/customer-sdk'

export default class App extends React.Component {
  customerSDK = null

  componentDidMount() {
    this.customerSDK = init({
      licenseId: LICENSE_ID,
      clientId: CLIENT_ID,
      redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
    })
    // you can start using customerSDK from now
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <AuthWebView />
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

If you are looking for something simpler, you can use a <a href="https://github.com/livechat/react-native-livechat" target="_blank">LiveChat for React Native</a> library. This is a React Native component to easily add the LiveChat Widget with basic functionality to your application.

# Key Concepts

The LiveChat system includes four basic types of entities - users, chats, threads, and events.

- Chats consist of threads and threads consist of events.
- Threads are parts of chats.
- Users can add events to chats, which then are automatically added to threads.
- Users can participate in many chats at the same time.

Threads are a vital part of the LiveChat architecture.
Grouping events in threads allows us to provide the continuous chat experience (i.e. the Customer always has the option to continue the conversation) while still maintaining smaller, logical chunks of events (e.g. for reporting and caching purposes).
Handling operations such as loading archival events from the chat history can be challenging, but you won't have to worry about managing threads most of the time.
Customer SDK provides wrappers for common tasks and most methods expect to receive chat IDs.
You will only get notified about thread metadata if you explicitly ask for it.

You can read more about key concepts of the LiveChat messaging in the [Messaging Overview](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/messaging/#key-concepts).

# Methods

## acceptGreeting

You can use this method to inform that a Customer has seen a greeting. Based on that, the Reports section displays only the greetings seen by Customers instead of all the sent greetings. If a Customer started a chat from a greeting but you didn't execute `acceptGreeting` method, the greeting counts as seen in Reports anyway.

As arguments to this method you should use `uniqueId` & `greetingId` received in the [`incoming_greeting`](#incoming_greeting) or [`connected`](#connected) event.

```js
customerSDK
  .acceptGreeting({
    greetingId: 7,
    uniqueId: 'Q10X0W041P',
  })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

Parameters:

| parameters | type   |
| ---------- | ------ |
| greetingId | number |
| uniqueId   | string |

### Errors

- `GREETING_NOT_FOUND` - a given `uniqueId` couldn't be found on the server

## activateChat

Activates an archived chat.

```js
customerSDK
  .activateChat({
    chat: {
      id: 'OU0V0P0OWT',
      thread: {
        events: [],
      },
    },
  })

| thread     | object   |                                      |

## getChatHistory

Helps loading in historical thread events.

First, call `getChatHistory` to access the `history` object of a particular chat.
The returned `history` object has only one method, `next`, which gives you a `Promise` with a `{ done, value }` object.

- `done` - indicates if there is anything more to load
- `value` - an object with an array of threads, each containing an array of its events

Then, you can keep calling `history.next()` multiple times to load previous historical events. They're going to be grouped into threads and might require merging with already loaded events.
This is useful for implementing an infinite scroll or otherwise showing your Customer's archival chats.
Keep in mind, though, that you generally shouldn't call `next` while the history is loading - we queue those requests, so the previous one must resolve before we proceed with the next one.

The structure such as our `history` object is called an **async iterator**.

```js
let wholeChatHistoryLoaded = false

const history = customerSDK.getChatHistory({ chatId: 'OU0V0P0OWT' })

history.next().then(result => {
  if (result.done) {
    wholeChatHistoryLoaded = true
  }

  const { threads } = result.value

  const events = threads
    .map(thread => thread.events || [])
    .reduce((acc, current) => acc.concat(current), [])

  console.log(events)
})
```

Parameters:

| parameters | type   | description                             |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| chatId     | string | Chat ID of the requested history object |

## getCustomer

Returns the info about the Customer requesting it.

```js
customerSDK
  .getCustomer()
  .then(customer => {
    console.log(customer)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

Returned value:

| properties                        | type       | description          |

})

document.getElementById('cancel-upload').onclick = () => {

# Disconnection reasons

Most of the disconnection reasons can be treated as errors. Because of that, you can find their detailed descriptions in this section.

```js
customerSDK.on('disconnected', ({ reason }) => {
  switch (reason) {
    case 'access_token_expired':
      // handle particular disconnection reasons
      break
    // ...
    default:
  }
})
```

## Access token expired

Access token lifetime has elapsed. Customer SDK fetches a new token and reconnects to the server on its own. This is emitted to the user for informational purposes, so for example a reconnection bar can be displayed.

## Connection lost

Disconnected because of the poor connection quality. Customer SDK will try to reconnect on its own.

## Customer banned

The Customer has been banned.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Customer temporarily blocked

The Customer tried reconnecting too many times after the [`"too_many_connections"`](#too-many-connections) error had occurred.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Identity mismatch

The identity of the Customer has changed between reconnects. This might happen if cookies can't be persisted in the browser.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Inactivity timeout

The Customer didn't chat or change the page in the past 30 minutes. Customer SDK **won't** try to reconnect on its own after receiving this error. You should implement a reconnect login on your own. Preferably you should only try to reconnect when you detect a clear intention of chatting from your user.

## Internal error

Internal error. Customer SDK reconnects on its own.

## License not found

The license with the specified ID doesn't exist. You should check the options passed in to Customer SDK and make sure that the license parameter is correct.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Misdirected connection

You have connected to a server in the wrong region. Customer SDK reconnects to the correct region on its own, but to avoid this problem altogether, you should provide the correct `region` parameter when initializing the SDK. This is emitted to the user for informational purposes, so for example a reconnection bar can be displayed.

## Too many connections

The Customer has reached the maximum number of connections. You should avoid opening too many concurrent connections for the same Customer.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Too many unauthorized connections

The maximum number of unauthorized connections has been reached. This error can only be received immediately after you try to connect to our servers when there are too many pending (unauthorized) connections. Once you get authorized, you stay that way and the Customer SDK reconnects on its own.

## Unsupported version

Connecting to an unsupported version of the Customer Chat API. You should upgrade your Customer SDK version.

This internally destroys the current instance of Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

## Users limit reached

The maximum number of Customers connected at the same time has been reached. This can only be received immediately after we try to connect to our servers, because once you get authorized, you stay that way. The limit is different for each plan, and you can check the exact values on our [pricing page](https://www.livechatinc.com/pricing/).

This internally destroys the current instance of the Customer SDK, so it won't be possible to reuse it.

# Errors

This is the list of standard error codes. You can receive them for all available methods which perform API calls. It means the errors can occur for methods returning Promises. Because we wrap API calls with Promise interface, the errors are available on the thrown `Error` objects under the `code` property. They can be caught using a regular Promise `catch` method.

There are also some per-method error codes, which are not described below. They are mentioned under corresponding methods instead.

## Connection lost

All in-flight requests fail with this one when the network connection gets lost.

## Customer banned

The Customer has been banned.

## Group not found

Can be received in response to any request that accepts a group somewhere in its payload.

## Internal

Internal error.

## Pending requests limit reached

This is a rate-limiting error.
You have sent out too many requests in a too short time period without waiting for them to resolve.

## Request timeout

The request has timed out.

## Validation

Wrong format of request, for example a `string` sent in the place of a `number`.

# Changelog

## [v2.0.1] - 2020-06-24

### Fixed

- `rateChat` and `cancelRate` methods are updating properties of the correct thread now.

## [v2.0.0] - 2020-06-22

### Changed

- The iterator returned from `getChatHistory` no longer returns `users`. User data needs to be obtained independently, for example by using the `getChat` method.
- `listChats` no longer accepts `offset` parameter. Instead, it now accepts `pageId` to which you can provide a value of `previousPageId` or `nextPageId` returned from the other `listChats` calls.
- Chat objects returned from `listChats` no longer have the `lastThreadOrder` property, but they received a new `lastThreadCreatedAt` property instead.
- The `threads` objects no longer have the `order` property, but they received a new `createdAt` property instead.
- The `eventsSeenUpToMap` is no longer available on the thread object, it has been moved to chat objects.
- The payload of the `chat_transferred` event was changed. It now always has the `reason` property. It contains the `queue` property if the chat has been transferred and queued immediately. `requesterId` is available when `reason` is equal to `"manual"`.

### Removed

- The `access_set` event has been removed. `chat_transferred` event covers for its use cases.
- The `getChatThreads` and the `getChatThreadsSummary` methods have been removed. Newly introduced `listThreads` can be used instead.

### Added

- The `listThreads` and `getChat` methods have been added.
- The thread objects gained back `userIds` property.
- The thread objects got `previousThreadId` and `nextThreadId` properties.
- The `sendTicketForm` methods accepts a new `timeZone` parameter which influences how times are formatted in a generated ticket.
- Queue objects got a new `queuedAt` property. This doesn't apply to the information returned in `queue_position_updated` event.

## [v2.0.0-beta.2] - 2020-04-02

### Changed

- Renamed methods:
  - `closeThread` to `deactivateChat`
  - `deleteChatThreadProperties` to `deleteThreadProperties`
  - `getChatsSummary` to `listChats`
  - `getGroupsStatus` to `listGroupStatuses`
  - `getUrlDetails` to `getUrlInfo`
  - `updateChatThreadProperties` to `updateThreadProperties`
- Renamed events:
  - `chat_thread_properties_deleted` to `thread_properties_deleted`
  - `chat_thread_properties_updated` to `thread_properties_updated`
  - `chat_user_added` to `user_added_to_chat`
  - `chat_user_removed` to `user_removed_from_chat`
  - `thread_closed` to `chat_deactivated`
- `chat_transferred` event doesn't contain `type` and `ids` properties anymore. Instead `transferredTo` property is available. It has optional `agentIds` and `groupIds` properties

### Added

- `customer` data available in the `connected` callback
- `statistics` property available on the Customer object returned from the `getCustomer` method

## [v2.0.0-beta.1] - 2020-03-13

### Fixed

- Updated the `@livechat/customer-auth` dependency, which has been previously published with broken dist files.

## [v2.0.0-beta.0] - 2020-03-12

### Changed

- Most methods have been changed to accept parameters by name instead of by position.
  We found this pattern to be easier to read and maintain in the long run.
  As an example, a call that previously might have looked like this: `customerSDK.updateChatProperties('ON0X0R0L67', properties)` will now look like this: `customerSDK.updateChatProperties({ chatId: 'ON0X0R0L67', properties })`.
  All methods and their respective parameters are described in the documentation.

- All data structures have been adjusted:
  Previously properties like `chat` or `thread` could hold a primitive value (usually a string) because they actually contained IDs.
  This has been confusing and all such properties have been renamed to have an `Id` suffix now.
  For example: `chat` was renamed to `chatId`, and `thread` was renamed to `threadId`.

- `updateCustomer` method now returns a Promise.
  Additionally, customer data is not sent automatically in the `login` request.
  If you still need to send customer data during the `login` request, you will need to provide a `customerDataProvider` in the configuration passed in the `init` call.
  This provider will be called before sending any `login` request.

- `connected` event no longer contains any chat information. You should use `getChatsSummary` and `getChatHistory` appropriately to fetch it.

- `getChatHistory` now returns an array of threads instead of an array of events.

- `sendEvent` can no longer activate an existing chat.
  You should use the `activateChat` method for that purpose.

- `new_event` event has been renamed to `incoming_event`.

- `customer_updated` doesn't provide the whole Customer object anymore.
  You will only receive the data that has actually been changed.

- Chat summary & incoming chat objects used to contain an array of user IDs.
  This has been changed to align with the API and you can now expect complete user objects in those objects.

- `getPredictedAgent` method requires a group argument now.

- `updateLastSeenTimestamp` method has been changed to `markEventsAsSeen`.

- `sendPostback` method has been changed to `sendRichMessagePostback`.

### Removed

- `reconnected` event got removed. You should just use a single `connected` handler for both initial connection and reconnets.

- `thread_summary` event got removed.

- `sendMessage` method has been removed. You can just use `sendEvent` to send any of the supported types of events.

- `user_is_typing` and `user_stopped_typing` events have been removed. You can use `incoming_typing_indicator` to receive those informations - it comes with a `isTyping` property.

- `user_joined_chat` and `user_left_chat` events have been renamed to `chat_user_added` and `chat_user_removed` respectively.

- `sendFile` method has been removed. You should use the new `uploadFile` method instead.

- Events of type `"annotation"` don't exist anymore. They were only used for rating events and now those are automatically added to a chat upon rating in a form of system events.

### Added

- `incoming_typing_indicator` event replaced `user_is_typing` and `user_stopped_typing` events.

- optional `queue` property has been added on thread objects.

- `chat_user_added` and `chat_user_removed` events replaced `user_joined_chat` and `user_left_chat` events respectively.

- `getForm` and `sendTicketForm` have been added.

- `deleteChatProperties`, `deleteChatThreadProperties` and `deleteEventProperties` methods have been added with accompanying `chat_properties_deleted`, `chat_thread_properties_deleted` and `event_properties_deleted` events.

- `acceptGreeting` and `cancelGreeting` have been added with accompanying `incoming_greeting`, `greeting_accepted` and `greeting_canceled` events.

- `getCustomer` method has been added.

- `setCustomerSessionFields` method has been added.

- `cancelRate` method has been added.

- `getGroupsStatus` method has been added.

- `uploadFile` method has been added. It replaces `sendFile` and doesn't add an event of type `"file"` to a chat but rather returns a URL which you can then use to send a `"file"` event using the `sendEvent` method.

- `queue_position_updated` event has been added.

- `availability_changed` event has been added.

- `event_updated` event has been added.

- `access_set` event has been added.

- `chat_transferred` event has been added.

- `connection_recovered` and `connection_unstable` have been added.

- All possible errors and disconnection reasons have been documented.

- SDK automatically reconnects to the correct region, but it's advised to pass the correct region of your license explicitly to the `init` function. `dal` is the default.

- Users of type `"agent"` got a `jobTitle` property.

- Events of type `"file"` got a `name` property.

- New types of rich message buttons have been added and some of them have additional properties. Buttons of type `"webview"` come with a `webviewHeight` and buttons of type `"url"` come with a `target`.

- `connected` event payload has a new `availability` property.

- You can send custom system message events using `sendEvent`.

## [v2.0.0-alpha.0] - 2018-08-17

Initial alpha release.

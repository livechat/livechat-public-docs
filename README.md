## Versioning

Currently, versioning for the Agent Chat API, Customer Chat API, and Configuration API is as follows:

|                 | Agent Chat API | Customer Chat API | Configuration API  | Reports API   |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| **stable**      | 3.4            | 3.4               | 3.4                | 3.4           |
| **dev preview** | 3.5            | 3.5               | 3.5                | 3.5           |
| **legacy**      | 3.2            | 3.2               | 2.0,  3.2          | 2.0, 3.3, 3.2 |
| **deprecated**  | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3  | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3     | 2.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 | -             |

This versioning is **default** for all articles which aren't grouped.

### Grouping versions

You can create a different set of versions for your `subcategories`.
If your article isn't using the **default** versioning, you can create a custom group of versions. In order to do that, you need to add your versions scheme into `/src/contant/index.js` e.g.

```js
export const VERSIONS_GROUPS = {
  ...
  "foo": {
    STABLE_VERSION: "1.0",
    DEV_PREVIEW_VERSION: "2.0",
    ALL_VERSIONS: ["1.0", "2.0"]
  }
```

Then inside the subcategory root `index.mdx` file, you must specify the newly created group in the frontmatter section e.g.

```
---

weight: 30
...
versionGroup: "foo"
```

The last step is to add the `versionGroup` and the specified `version` inside your article. Please, also remember to add `versionGroup` to all the siblings (all documents within the same subcategory). You don't have to specify `version` for them, but `versionGroup` is required.

### Adding a new version

Run this command to automatically create folders and files for a new version of the API documentation.

`new` e.g. `npm run version -- --type=new --newVersion=3.5 --fromVersion=3.1` (create new version 3.5 based on files from 3.1)

Options:

- `--group`: (default: DEFAULT), for chat widget use `--group=chat-widget`
- `--exclude`: e.g. `--exclude=agent-chat-api,customer-chat-api`

### Changing the stable version

Run this command to automatically change the stable version of the API documentation. All the necessary files and folders will be created, moved, and deleted.

`make-stable` e.g. `npm run version -- --type=make-stable --newVersion=3.3 --exclude=customer-chat-api` (make version 3.3 stable, current stable version will become legacy)

Options:

- `--group`: (default: DEFAULT), for chat widget use `--group=chat-widget`
- `--exclude`: e.g. `--exclude=agent-chat-api,customer-chat-api`

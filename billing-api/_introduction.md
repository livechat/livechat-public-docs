The LiveChat Billing API allows you to charge for your apps in the LiveChat Marketplace. Therefore, you can offer paid applications to over 22,000 LiveChat customers.

The Billing API is a collective name for a subset of smaller APIs used for specific purposes (see the [APIs section](#2-apis) below for details).

## Overview

### Payment types

The Billing API supports the following payment types:

* direct charges (one-time charges)

* per-usage payments (coming soon)

### Additional options

It also handles a set of features to facilitate the payment and accounting processes:

* credit card processing

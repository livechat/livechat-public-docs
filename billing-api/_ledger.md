# Ledger

The Ledger API handles the financial activity and balance.

## Entry object types

* `collection` - the amount has beed added
* `refund` - the amount has been deducted
* `withdrawal` - the amount has been paid off

## Ledger entry object

This is the structure of a single Ledger entry object:

```
{
	"id":"50af517e-c5aa-4af3-93c2-e60d612c43eb",
	"name":"app1",
	"type":"collection",
	"value":160,
	"created_at":"2017-11-20T15:48:13Z"
}
```

## Scopes

Ledger API requires `ledger_read` scope for all endpoints. If you want to use this API, you must create an app in Developers Console and check the “ledger_read” scope in the app settings. After successful authorization (by using Sign in with LiveChat), you will get an access token with “ledger_read” scope.

## Endpoints

* `GET /v1/ledger` - returns the current ledger. It lists up to 20 entries, use `?page=X` for pagination. Required format: `{result: [LEDGER ENTRY 1, LEDGER ENTRY 2, ...]}`,
* `PUT /v1/direct_charge/:ID/accept` - returns the current ledger balance in cents. Format: `{"balance": 10}`

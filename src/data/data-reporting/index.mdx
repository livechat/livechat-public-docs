# Introduction

The LiveChat Platform lets you extract data from all the [Reports](https://www.livechat.com/help/reporting-options-available-in-livechat/) available in LiveChat. You can use this data to create your own reports, build custom dashboards or set up custom email reporting.

## Use cases

There are a number of ways to leverage the Reports API:

- export data to Excel ([see blogpost](https://developers.livechat.com/blog/how-to-get-livechat-api-data-with-microsoft-excel-or-power-bi/)) or 3rd-party analytics and BI tools,
- create dashboards for teams ([like this one](https://dashboard.livechatinc.com/)),
- set up alerting and notifications for specific metrics,
- schedule custom email reporting.

## API versioning

The Reports API goes through several stages in its lifecycle.

|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **legacy**      | We're gradually dropping support for this version. It receives only critical and security bug fixes. Lasts for ~1-1.5 year. Responses contain the `Legacy` header that specifies when this stage ends (in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format).                                              |
| **deprecated**  | It receives only critical and security bug fixes. Lasts for 6 months before it's decommissioned. Responses contain the `Deprecation` header that specifies when this stage ends (in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format).                                                                    |

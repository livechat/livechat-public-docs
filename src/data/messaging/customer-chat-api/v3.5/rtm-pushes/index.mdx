This document contains a reference of **pushes** available in the **LiveChat Customer Chat API**. Similarly to [webhooks](/management/webhooks), pushes notify you when specific events occur. They're usually generated as result of RTM API actions, but it's also possible to receive them in result of Web API actions.

## Introduction

Here's what you need to know about **pushes**:

- They are generated primarily by RTM API actions, but also by Web API actions.
- They notify you when specific events occur.
- Can be **delivered** only in the websocket transport.
- You don't need to register pushes to receive them.
- Their equivalents in Web API are [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/v3.5/#webhooks). Pushes and webhooks have similar payloads.
- There are no retries for pushes. To determine if a customer has seen an event, compare the [event's](/messaging/customer-chat-api/v3.5/data-structures/#response) `created_at` parameter with the [customer's](/messaging/customer-chat-api/v3.5/data-structures/#customer) `events_seen_up_to` field.

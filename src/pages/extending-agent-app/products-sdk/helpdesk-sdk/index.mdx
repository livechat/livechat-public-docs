# Introduction

App Widgets are web applications loaded inside the **HelpDesk App**. They live in iframes and can interact and communicate with the HelpDesk App. Read about their possible locations in the [App locations](/extending-agent-app#app-locations) guide. The HelpDesk SDK is currently the primary way to develop your own widgets and can be used in a [basic](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#basic-use) or [advanced](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#advanced-use) way.

## Use cases

Widgets are primary elements of the HelpDesk user interface. You can use them to:

- automate your processes and workflows.
- integrate external online services or applications.
- customize your views, reports, or payment methods.
- translate your messages or tickets.

## Before you start

From a technical point of view, widgets are regular web applications. For that reason, you need to have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your own widget.

Bear in mind that widgets are front-end elements of the HelpDesk App. If your intention is to build a server-side app, we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs" target="_blank">HelpDesk API</a>.

# Getting started

Follow the instructions to create a basic HelpDesk Widget. Before you start, make sure you <a href="https://accounts.livechat.com/signup" target="_blank">have an account</a>.

1. Go to the Apps section in <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />.
2. Click **Create new app +** and give your app a name.
3. Decide which product you want to build your app for.
4. If you do not have a HelpDesk account, you will be asked to activate it.
5. Go to **Building blocks** and add a new **HelpDesk Widgets** block.
    - Enter the **Widget source URL**, which is the address of your application.
    - Choose the **widget placement**. It allows you to decide where exactly in the HelpDesk App you want to display your integration. Currently, the possible locations are the Details section, Fullscreen Apps (main menu), or App Settings. [Read more](/extending-agent-app#app-locations) about app locations.  
6. Additionally, you can configure your app's short decription and add an icon for better visibility in the HelpDesk App. You can do that in the **Display details** tab.
7. Go to the **Private installation** tab and install the app on your account.

After the successful installation, you'll see the widget in your HelpDesk App.

## Installing the SDK

You can download the SDK directly from NPM as an ES6 or CommonJS module.

Install the SDK from NPM...

<CodeSample>

```
npm install @livechat/helpdesk-sdk
```

</CodeSample>

...then import the ES6 module...

<CodeSample>

```js
import * as HelpDesk from "@livechat/helpdesk-sdk";
```

</CodeSample>

...or require the CommonJS.

<CodeSample>

```js
const HelpDesk = require("@livechat/helpdesk-sdk");
```

</CodeSample>

You can also use the UMD build of the SDK directly in the browser.

You can also use the UMD build:

<CodeSample>

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@livechat/helpdesk-sdk@1.0.3/dist/helpdesk-sdk.umd.min.js"></script>
<script>
  HelpDesk.createDetailsWidget().then(function(widget) {
    // do something with widget
  });
</script>
```

</CodeSample>

# Basic use

The specific usage of the HelpDesk SDK depends on the type of widget you want to create. The currently available widget types are the following:

- [Details widget](#details-widgets)
- [Fullscreen widget](#fullscreen-widgets)

All widgets created with the HelpDesk SDK share a common interface, which lets you listen for the events happening in the HelpDesk App.

Supposing that `widget` is a widget instance:

<CodeSample>

```js
function handleEvent(event) {
  // perform logic when event happens,
  // you can also use the data attached to the event
}

// Subscribe to event
widget.on("event", handleEvent);

// Unsubscribe from event
widget.off("event", handleEvent);
```

</CodeSample>

Each widget type offers a different set of events that you can listen for.

## Details widgets

If you want to use your app in the Details section, you should use the `createDetailsWidget` function. It returns a promise resolving to a details widget instance.

<CodeSample>

```js
import { createDetailsWidget } from "@livechat/helpdesk-sdk";

createDetailsWidget().then(widget => {
  // build your logic around the widget
});
```

</CodeSample>

### Events

#### `ticket_info`

Emitted when an agent opens a conversation within tickets, or when an agents selects the ticket. The handler will get the ticket object as an argument.

Listen for the ticket changes:

<CodeSample>

```js
widget.on("ticket_info", ticketInfo => {
  // read the ticket object
});
```

</CodeSample>

The ticket object will have the following shape:

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buttonId` | The `id` of the button taken from the section definition |

React to button clicks within Ticket Details widgets

<CodeSample>

```js
widget.on("ticket_details_section_button_click", ({ buttonId }) => {
  // perform an action when the button is clicked
});
```

</CodeSample>

### Methods

#### Get the ticket info

If you want to access the current ticket, you should use the `getTicketInfo` method.

Get the current ticket info

<CodeSample>

```js
const ticketInfo = widget.getTicketInfo();
```

</CodeSample>

The returned profile will be an object identical to the one emitted by the `tickets_info` event. It can also be `null` if no info was recorded.

#### Modify Ticket Details widget's state

If you configured a [Ticket Details widget](#creating-a-ticket-details-widget), you can modify its section state using the `modifySection` method. The method accepts the section state definition as its only parameter, and returns a promise.

You can look up the [component types](#component-types) to see how to create the state definition.

The `title` of a given section has to match the one specified in the Opening state. Otherwise, the section won't change. Also, the HelpDesk App ignores the commands without valid section definitions. Make sure that the definition you're sending is correct.

Modify the Ticket Details widget's state

<CodeSample>

```js
widget
  .modifySection({
    title: "My widget",
    components: [
      {
        type: "title",
        data: {
          value: "The title will be modified"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
  .then(() => {
    // the widget should be modified now
  });
```

</CodeSample>

## Fullscreen widgets

If you want to connect a Fullscreen widget to the HelpDesk App, you should use the `createFullscreenWidget` function. It returns a promise resolving to a Fullscreen widget instance.

<CodeSample>

```js
import { createFullscreenWidget } from "@livechat/helpdesk-sdk";

createFullscreenWidget().then(widget => {
  // build your logic around the widget
});
```

</CodeSample>

### Events

This widget currently does not support any events.

### Methods

#### Set notification badge

If you want to notify Agents there’s something important inside the widget, use the `setNotificationBadge` method.

<CodeSample>

```js
widget.setNotificationBadge(26);
```

</CodeSample>

It displays a notification badge on top of your app’s icon:

<p style={{maxWidth: "70px"}}>
  <img src="/images/extending-agent-app/fullscreen-widget-badge.png" alt="Fullscreen widget badge" width="70px" height="190px" />
</p>

If you want to remove the badge, invoke the method with the `null` parameter.

<CodeSample>

```js
widget.setNotificationBadge(null);
```

</CodeSample>

Make sure Agents can dismiss the notification to avoid cluttered UI.

# Advanced use

## Developing your own widget

If you're building your own widget and you need to interact with the HelpDesk App, be sure to use the [HelpDesk SDK](#top).

## Accessing HelpDesk data

You can leverage the OAuth 2.1 authorization flow to use <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs" target="_blank">HelpDesk API</a>. Head to [Sign in with LiveChat](/getting-started/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat/) docs for more information.

## Layout and Styling

If you're using React, you can use the [LiveChat Design System](/extending-ui/extending-agent-app/design-system/), which is a component library used directly in the LiveChat user interface.

## Hosting the widget

You can host your widget locally or on a dedicated server. The hosted content has to be served over the **HTTPS Protocol**.

During development, you can use a self-signed certificate for `localhost` or upload your widget to an SSL-enabled host. You can also leverage bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to use an https-enabled development server.

If you need a quick way to **deploy** your widget, you can use [Netlify Drop](https://developers.livechat.com/updates/widget-hosting-on-netlify/).

## Creating a Ticket Details widget

When developing an app in the **Details section**, you can add some content to the **Opening state** and display it in the **Opening state preview**. This way, you turn it into a Ticket Details widget.

Let's define the terms we use in this document:

- **Section** - an element of Ticket Details. It contains a complete set of information grouped under a single widget.
- **Component** - a single line in a section. It can have one of the pre-defined formats and be filled with data from the app.

### How to add a widget

To display a widget, we have introduced the **Opening state**, which allows you to add components to your application and see a live preview of what the app will look like in the **Opening state preview**.

The components you may add are:

- [Header](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#header)
<!-- - [Item](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#item) -->
- [Button](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#button)
- [Label with value](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#label-with-value)
- [Link](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#link)
- [Divider](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#divider)

To read more about the HelpDesk Widgets, please see our [App Guides](/getting-started/app-guides/helpdesk-widgets).

### How to update a section

You can control your widget and change its components using the HelpDesk SDK. Please refer to the [Modify the Customer Details widget](#modify-ticket-details-widgets-state).

### Component types

Here's the list of all the components you can use to build the Ticket Details app.

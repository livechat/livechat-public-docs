# Introduction

Developer UI Toolkit is a TypeScript library with React components and views that should be used in applications built for Text Marketplace. It is available in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-ui-react" target="_blank">the npm registry</a>.

The library is designed to help developers build beautiful and responsive applications that follow Text's design rules. All the views were built based on the components from the offical Text Design System. The Developer UI Toolkit extends the <Placeholder id="DESIGN_SYSTEM_URL" />, providing new components that were designed specifically for 3rd party application use cases.

# Views

## Loading view

Loading view was created to unify the loading state among applications, therefore it doesn't leave much room for customization. It's a simple view with a loading spinner and a message that says "Loading an external application...".

| Prop | Required | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `label` | No | `string` | A message that will be displayed below the loading spinner. <br/>Default: `Loading application...` <br/>In general, the default copy shouldn't be changed unless you're using this component to load some part of your application.|

<CodeSample path={'LOADING VIEW'}>

```js
import { AppLoader } from '@livechat/developer-ui-react';

const Loader = () => (
  <div>
    <AppLoader label="Loading your application..." />
  </div>
);
```

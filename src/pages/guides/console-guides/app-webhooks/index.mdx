App webhooks allow you to keep track of how often your application is installed and uninstalled. If the application is paid, you will also receive payment webhooks.

## Bulding block configuration

If you want to be notified about your app installation, uninstallation, and payment events, configure an App Webhooks building block in <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. To do that, provide a URL to your backend that will receive the webhooks.

This document contains a reference of **pushes** available in the **LiveChat Agent Chat API**. Similarly to [webhooks](/management/webhooks), pushes notify you when specific events occur. They're usually generated as result of RTM API actions, but it's also possible to receive them in result of Web API actions.

## Introduction

Here's what you need to know about **pushes**:

- They are generated primarily by RTM API actions, but also by Web API actions.
- They notify you when specific events occur.
- Can be **delivered** only in the websocket transport.
- You don't need to register pushes to receive them.
- Their equivalents in Web API are [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks). Pushes and webhooks have similar payloads.
- There are no retries for pushes. To determine if a user has seen an event, compare the [event's](/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/data-structures/#response) `created_at` parameter with the [user's](/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/data-structures/#users) `events_seen_up_to` field.

<CodeResponse title={'Sample push payload'}>

```json
{
  "id": "PJ0MRSHTDG",
  "access": {
  "group_ids": [1]
  }
}
```

</CodeResponse>

#### Push payload

| Field | Notes   |
| ----- | ------- |
| `id`  | Chat ID |

</CodeResponse>

#### Push payload

<CodeResponse title={'Sample push payload'}>

  "requester_id": "cb531744-e6a4-4ded-b3eb-b3eb4ded4ded",
  "transferred_to": {
    "group_ids": [ 1 ],
    "agent_ids": ["smith@example.com"],
  },
  "queue": {
    "position": 42,
    "wait_time": 1337,
    "queued_at": "2019-12-09T12:01:18.909000Z"
  }
}
```

</CodeResponse>

#### Push payload

| Field                   | Notes                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `thread_id`             | Present if the chat is active                        |
| `transferred_to` **\*** | IDs of groups and Agents the chat is now assigned to |
| `queue`                 | Present if the chat is queued after the transfer     |

**\*)**
One of the following combinations of IDs is possible:

- Both `group_ids` and `agent_ids`. In situations when a chat was transferred to a group and it was immediately assigned to an Agent (even if the chat transfer occurred in the same group).
- Only `group_ids`. When a chat was transferred to a group and no Agents were available; the queue will be present.
- Only `agent_ids`. When a chat was transferred directly to an Agent; there'll be no queue.

# Introduction

Messaging lies at the core of LiveChat communication. Chatting between agents and customers is the most fundamental functionality of the LiveChat software.

As a developer, you can access our **Messaging APIs** (Agent Chat & Customer Chat APIs) or **SDKs** to build integrations that operate on the chatting functionality.

This document gives you an overview of the LiveChat messaging protocol, explaining concepts such as **chats, therads, events, routing**, and more, which are essential to understand how messaging works in LiveChat.

# Key concepts

## Chats and threads

By looking at the chat structure, you notice that each **chat** is is divided into **threads**. Every thread contains **events**, for example sent messages. You can think of a **chat** as _**a whole conversation**_, while **threads** are separate _**conversation topics**_.
<img alt="Chats and Thread" src="/images/messaging/chat_threads.png" title="chats and threads" width="800px" height="970px"/>

Consider the example of an online store. A customer starts a chat to ask about the shoes he bought. If he hasn't got any previous chat history, **a new chat is started**. Within this chat, **a new thread is created** (conversation topic). The messages he exchanges with the customer service assistant are received by the thread as **events**. After solving the problem, the customer says goodbye and closes the chat, which automatically **closes the thread**. Let's say the customer is rude and leaves without saying goodbye. In this case, the thread closes after 30 minutes of inactivity (time periods are configurable). The chat **doesn't end**, though.

The next day, customer returns to ask about his other purchase. A new thread starts in the context of the chat, which has been **continuously open**. Each time customer returns and starts a new conversation topic, he needs to click **_start a chat_**. If we stuck to our naming convention, that would have to be **_start a thread_**, because this is what he actually does behind the scenes.

A **message** or **rich message** are not the only event types, though. There are also special events for specific actions, like: **file**, **filled form**, **system** and **custom** messages.

## Rules and conditions

Here are some general rules, which summarize the previous section and add new info.

1. When a new chat is started, **a new active thread** is created within this chat. New threads within a single chat are created on the server side.

2. There's always **only one active thread**. Only the **last thread** can be the **active** one. Events are always added to the active thread.

3. There can be time gaps between threads in a chat, but once a chat is started, it's **continuously open**.

4. Messages are sent and delivered even when the recipient (both customer and agent) is **offline**.

5. **Multiple agents** can participate in a single chat.

6. Every user can have **multiple concurrent chats**. Read how it applies to agents ([chatting as agent](#chatting-as-agent)) and customers ([chatting as customer](#chatting-as-customer)).

7. The algorithm that decides how chats are distributed between agents is called **routing**. It's documented in the [Routing](#chat-routing) section.

### Chatting as agent

The number of chats an agent can participate in is not limited. It can be configured in the Agent App by the license Owner or Admin.

### Chatting as customer

By default, a customer can only have one chat started, unless he chats with agents who use different licences. The licence Owner or Admin can change that default value, modifying the `routing.max_customer_chats_count` property. However, in order to support this functionality, you would need to build a custom Chat Widget. For now, the LiveChat Chat Widget doesn't support it. You can build a Chat Widget from the ground up using the [Customer SDK](../extending-ui/extending-chat-widget/customer-sdk/).

Chats are continuous so customers can always preview their chats' history. Yet, with **multiple concurrent chats** customers can sort their chats out thematically, making sure they know what each chat is about.

## Chat routing

Routing is the process of **assigning chats to agents**. The primary goal of the routing mechanism is to distribute chats to all available agents who use the same license.

Chats are being assigned to agents **either automatically or manually**. Our default routing mechanisms are described in [Understanding chat routing](https://www.livechat.com/help/understanding-chat-routing/).

### Router system messages

While the chat changes its state, the router sends system messages. Read more about **system messages** in [Agent Chat API](./agent-chat-api/data-structures/#system-message) and [Customer Chat API](./customer-chat-api/data-structures/#system-message).

## Flow between services

Watch a short video that illustrates the basic flow between services in LiveChat.

</video>

For more technical details, analyze the diagrams and read the descriptions below.

### Basic flow

<img alt="Basic flow between services in LiveChat" src="/images/messaging/livechat-flow.png" width="800px" height="326px" />

The LiveChat communication protocol uses websockets ([RTM API](#rtm-api-vs-web-api)). They act like tubes that connect two sides and enable transport between them. In the basic model of the LiveChat services, there are two websocket connections:

- Agent App and the LiveChat's backend
- the LiveChat's backend and Chat Widget

The first connection allows for sending an event, for example, a message, by an agent to the LiveChat's backend. The [`send_event`](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#send-event) action triggers the LiveChat's backend to generate a push. The [`incoming_event`](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#incoming_event) push is sent to the Chat Widget via the other websocket. The push contains the message written by the agent.

Apart from pushes, actions can also trigger the LiveChat's backend to generate webhooks. To receive a webhook, you need to [register it](/management/configuration-api/#register-webhook) first. That's how you let the LiveChat's backend know you want to be notified about certain actions. The LiveChat's backend will send webhooks to the target webhook URL you specify during webhook registration.

### Flow with integrations

Developers can build integrations that extend LiveChat's messaging capabilities, for example, via a new communication channel. Consider the example of the <a href="https://www.livechat.com/marketplace/apps/facebook-messenger/" target="_blank">integration app</a> that connects LiveChat with Facebook Messenger. Keep in mind the flow presented in the diagram below is typical for a new communication channel and it would be different for an app that simply extends the LiveChat UI.

<img alt="livechat-integrations-flow" src="/images/messaging/livechat-integrations-flow.png" width="800px" height="326px"/>

An agent [sends a message](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#send-event) via a websocket connection. It triggers the LiveChat's backend to send a webhook to the integration app, informing about the [incoming event](/management/webhooks/#incoming_chat). In response to the webhook, the integration sends an HTTP request to the external backend (in this case it's Facebook). They use transport of their choice to pass the message to the customer chatting via Facebook Messenger.

# Messaging APIs

There are two primary Messaging APIs:

- **the Agent Chat API** for chatting as an agent.
- **the Customer Chat API** for chatting as a customer.

To use both APIs, you need to be _authorized_. We explained this topic in the [Authorizing API calls](/authorization/authorizing-api-calls/) document.

## RTM API vs. Web API

Our Messaging APIs support two forms of transport thus exisiting in the form of **Web APIs** and **Real-time APIs (RTM APIs)**.

To learn about the differences between Web and RTM APIs, analyze the following comparison:

## API Versioning

The LiveChat Messaging APIs adopt the following versioning convention:

- **stable**

  The latest stable version we encourage developers to use. We don't introduce any new functionalities or breaking changes - only bug fixes are expected.

- **developer preview (dev preview)**

  An unstable version that provides a preview of the upcoming features. **It's not open to public use.** However, if you want to test some features, contact us at developers@livechat.com or <a href="#open-chat" onClick={openChatWindow}>ask on the chat</a>, and we'll give you access.

- **legacy**

  The old version we still support but highly encourage you to switch to the latest stable version.

**Currently:**

|                 | Agent Chat API | Customer Chat API |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| **stable**      | 3.3            | 3.3               |
| **dev preview** | 3.4            | 3.4               |
| **legacy**      | 3.1, 3.2       | 3.1, 3.2          |

# Agent side

Agent-side communication allows you to chat not only as an agent **but also as a bot** (also known as bot agent). You can perform **simple actions** such as **browsing archives** or **banning customers** or **build your custom agent application** (a [sample one](/messaging/chat-sdk/#simple-agent) was built using Chat SDK).

You can call the Agent Chat API directly or use our SDKs built on top of it.

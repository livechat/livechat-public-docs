# Introduction

This Software Development Kit, written in Python, is a tool for developers to build external backend apps, which extend LiveChat features. The SDK makes it easy to use the [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/), the [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api/), and the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/).

# SDK & Docs

The SDK is available on GitHub along with a usage example. Currently, the SDK documentation is available only in HTML, but soon it will be available in a more convenient format, _typedoc_.

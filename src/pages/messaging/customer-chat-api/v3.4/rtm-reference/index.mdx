# Introduction

## Versioning

This document describes the **Customer Chat Real-Time Messaging API v3.4**. This is the developer preview version that provides a preview of the upcoming changes to the API. **It's not open to public use.** However, if you want to test some features, contact us at developers@livechat.com or <a href="#open-chat" onClick={openChatWindow}>ask on the chat</a>, and we'll give you access.

## What is RTM API

Real-Time Messaging API (RTM API) is based on a websocket-like connection. Client can send a **request message** that results in getting a **response message**. It's also possible to get **push messages**.

## When to use RTM API

If you're wondering which API to use - Customer Chat **RTM API** or **Web API**, keep on reading.

**Real-Time Messaging API** allows for building stateful integrations that require **logging in** and **maintaining the connection**. Since connection maintenance is required, the implementation might be more challenging than with Web API.

Customer Chat RTM API enables communication in real time. It supports pushes like `sneak peek`, `typing indicator`, and other. Web API doesn’t have equivalent webhooks, which means you won't be informed about certain events using Web API.

Also, the RTM API will be a better choice if you want to avoid time delays or presume significant traffic.

**Not what you're looking for?** Perhaps, you need to use [**Customer Chat Web API**](..) instead.

## Access

The basics on authorization and server pinging in the Customer Chat RTM API.

### Authorization

**Customer authorization** is handled with access tokens. Find out how to get an **access token** from [Customer authorization flow](/authorization/authorizing-api-calls/#customer-authorization-flow). You need to authorize within 30 seconds from establishing the connection. Otherwise, the connection will be closed. Given that the connection is continuosly maintained, you only need to authorize once.

### Server pinging

After successful authorization, the client needs to **ping the server** every 15 seconds. Otherwise, the connection will be closed after about 30 seconds of inactivity. Until authorization is completed, ping is a no-op.

Use one of these 2 ways of pinging the server:

- **Protocol message with the ping action**

For web applications and backend integrations (e.g. in Python, Go). Send the following request every 15 seconds:

```json
{
  "action": "ping",
  "payload": {}
}
```

After pinging the server, the client will receive a response with the `ping` action. Thanks to that, the client can make sure the connection is still alive.

- **The control frame ping in the websocket protocol**

For backend integrations; unavailable in web browsers. Read more about the [control frame ping](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2).

## Data centers

LiveChat system operates in two data centers: `dal` (USA) and `fra` (Europe). The default data center is `dal`.

For backend applications, you can specify the region in the request header. The mechanism is the same as in [Customer Chat Web API reference](../#data-centers). It doesn't work for frontend applications, though.
Instead, frontend apps connect to a region different than the default one by specifying the region suffix in the URL.

**`fra`:** `wss://api-fra.livechatinc.com/v3.4/customer/rtm/ws`

**`dal`:** `wss://api.livechatinc.com/v3.4/customer/rtm/ws`

## Pagination

Pagination is a mechanism that allows splitting the database output into more manageable chunks of data.
Based on the `limit` and `sort order` parameters, pagination is able to decide how many records will be returned at once and whether it should fetch the oldest or the latest data first.

Any filters that could be applied should be provided in first pagination request. In the response, you'll get the `next_page_id` and `previous_page_id` parameters.
You should make the subsequent request using one of these parameters as `page_id`, depending on the direction of iteration: forward or backward.

The `filters`, `limit`, and `sort_order` parameters can't be provided along with `page_id`.

💡 The maximum duration of the `page_id` parameter before it expires is one month.

# Events

One of the data structures are **events**. They are sent to a chat via the `send_event` method.
Apart from events, there are also [Properties](#properties), [Users](#users), and [Other common data structures](#other-common-structures).

These are the available **event types**:

- [File](#file)
- [Form](#form)
- [Filled form](#filled-form)
- [Message](#message)
- [Rich message](#rich-message)
- [Custom](#custom)
- [System message](#system-message)

## File

<Section>

<Text>

The **File** event informs about an uploaded file.

### Accept Greeting

Marks an incoming greeting as seen.

**How it's implemented in LiveChat:**

The Chat Widget uses this method to inform that a Customer has seen a greeting. Based on that, the Reports section displays the greetings
that were actually seen by Customers, not all the sent greetings. If a Customer started a chat from a greeting, but the **Accept Method** wasn't executed,
the greeting is still counted as seen in Reports.

#### Specifics

|                        |                                           |

# Pushes

Here's what you need to know about **pushes**:

- They are generated primarily by RTM API actions, but also by Web API actions.
- They notify you when specific events occur.
- Can be **delivered** only in the websocket transport.
- You don't need to register pushes to receive them.
- Their equivalents in Web API are [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/v3.4/#webhooks). Pushes and webhooks have similar payloads.
- There are no retries for pushes. To determine if a customer has seen an event, compare the [event's](#response) `created_at` parameter with the [customer's](#customer) `events_seen_up_to` field.

# Introduction

[Developer Console](https://developers.livechat.com/console/) allows you not only to create [LiveChat Apps](/getting-started/livechat-apps). It is also possible to develop integrations for HelpDesk and publish them on the Marketplace.

Connect your HelpDesk to an external tool or service, extend HelpDesk user interface, or automate various tasks. Configure different functionalities, integrate with the LiveChat ecosystem, or create your own custom actions for agents in HelpDesk.

# App capabilities

LiveChat provides developers with multiple tools which allow your app to do many different things, for example:

- Integrate with other products and services
- Extend HelpDesk user interfaces
- Create your own custom actions for agents in HelpDesk
- Automate tasks with webhooks
- Let users sign in to your service with Sign in with LiveChat

If you plan to make your app public for everyone, check out our [monetization](/monetization/how-to-monetize-apps) and distribution tools.

# Creating HelpDesk apps

## Step-by-step guide

If you want to create a simple HelpDesk app in the Developer Console, follow the instructions we’ve prepared. We'll use an app named Your Buddy as our example.

### Step 1 Getting started

To start, you need to check if you are signed in to the [Developer Console](https://developers.livechat.com/console/). You can [sign up here](https://accounts.livechat.com/signup). However, your LiveChat or HelpDesk credentials should log you in automatically. 

The first step in the Developer Console is to go to the **Apps** tab and click the **Create new app +** button. Give your app a name and click the **Continue** button. The application's name can be changed later.

Next, you need to decide which product you want to build your app for. In this tutorial guide, we will take care of the HelpDesk product. However, if you would like to check out how to build LiveChat apps, find more details [here](/getting-started/livechat-apps). The logo of the chosen product will be visible on the left side of your screen, under the **Building Blocks** tab.

</div>

If you do not have a HelpDesk account, you will be asked to activate it. If you want to activate HelpDesk and start a free trial, click **Activate HelpDesk** button.

</div>

💡 **Need a helping hand?** Right after signing in to the Developer Console, you can launch the **App wizard**. It will guide you through the whole app creation process.

### Step 2 Adding HelpDesk Widgets block

You can form your app using components called Building blocks. Each building block works differently. To read more about Building Blocks, click the **Read more** redirect or go to the [App guides](/getting-started/app-guides) section in our documentation.

In this guide, we will use the HelpDesk Widgets building block. Widgets are web apps that can interact and communicate with the HelpDesk App. They are loaded inside the HelpDesk App interface.

  src="/images/getting-started/helpdesk-apps/livechat-helpdesk-apps-building-blocks.png"
  width="1460px"
  height="796px"
/>

To add a new Widget to your application, you need to follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Building blocks** tab.
2. Add a new HelpDesk Widgets block by clicking the **+ Add building block** button and then choosing **HelpDesk Widgets**.
3. Enter the **Widget source URL**, which is the address of your application. If it's not ready yet, you can use our [sample apps](/extending-agent-app/agent-app-sdk#sample-apps) to play around.
4. Now, go to the **Widget placement** and choose one of the options. It allows you to decide where exactly in the HelDesk App you want to display your integration. We've chosen the **Full screen** option in our example. In the HelpDesk App, Full screen apps are located in the navigation bar on the left, and they open maximized in the HelpDesk App. [Learn more...](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app#main-menu-fullscreen-apps)
5. The **Opening state** section is not required and works only for the **Ticket Details** widget placement. It allows you to add components to your application and see a live preview of what the app will look like in the **Opening state preview**.
6. Click the **Create** button and enjoy your app's first building block.

### Step 3 Configuring Display details

Now, it is time for the **Display details** tab that allows you to configure your app's short description and add an icon for better visibility in the HelpDesk App.

Follow the steps below to add a description and icon:

1. Go to the **Display details** tab.
2. In the **Short description** section, add a one-sentence description of your app to make your users aware of what your app does, and save your changes. You can change the description later.
3. Add an icon for your app and save your changes. Your icon will be displayed on the Marketplace and the HelpDesk App. You can drag and drop your image or browse your file manager for it.

/>

### Step 4 Configuring Listing details

The next step is adding a few details of your app’s functionalities to make it easier to understand for your users.

To do that, go to the **Listing details** tab and fill in all the details.

### Step 5 Testing your application

Before you are able to publish your application on the Marketplace, you need to test it first to ensure that no bugs or errors appear.

To do that, you need to install your app privately on your license by going to the **Private installation** tab and clicking the **Install app** button.

XXX

When the installation is done, you can return to your HelpDesk App and refresh the page. After doing that, you’ll see your widget.

Please remember that your widget placement in the HelpDesk App will depend on which widget placement you've chosen while creating the new HelpDesk Widget.

Congratulations! Now, you can enjoy your simple application under your license. If you want to build a public app, please go to the [app review process page](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/monetization/app-review-process), where you’ll get all the necessary details on this process and find out how to submit your application for review.

# Introduction

The LiveChat Widget for iOS allows the app users to contact the chat agents directly from a mobile application. The widget is very easy for developers to integrate into their existing iOS apps.

The source code and installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios).

Version 2.0 of the widget has several significant improvements over the previous version that
can be found [here](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios/tree/e615b6e10848ece7c255407a6fff8485a92700aa).

# User guide

You integrate LiveChat into your project manually or with a dependency manager.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 8.0+

## Installation

### Carthage

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to manage your dependencies, simply add 'livechat/chat-window-ios' to your `Cartfile`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'LIVECHAT/CHAT-WINDOW-IOS'}>

```
github "livechat/chat-window-ios" ~> 2.0.20
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

Make sure you have added `LiveChat.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have include it in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage your dependencies, simply add LiveChat to your `Podfile`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'LIVECHAT TO PODFILE'}>

```bash
pod 'LiveChat', '~> 2.0.20'
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Manual Installation

You can integrate iOS chat widget into your project manually without using a dependency manager.

#### Swift

Just drag all files from the `LiveChat/Sources` directory into your project.

#### Objective-C

Drag all files from the `LiveChat/Sources` directory into your project. When adding first `*.swift` file to Objective-C project, Xcode will ask you to create a Bridging Header. It is not necessary for chat widget to work, so you can decline unless you plan to call Swift code from Objective-C. More information about bridging headers and Swift and Objective-C interoperability can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html). You need to put the following import statement: `#import "<Your Project Name>-Swift.h"` at the top of your .m file.

Also, for Objective-C projects, you need to set the **Embedded Content Contains Swift Code** flag in your project to `Yes` (found under **Build Options** in the **Build Settings** tab).

## Usage

### Initalization

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'INITALIZATION'}>

```swift
import LiveChat

LiveChat.licenseId = "YOUR_LICENSE_ID"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Presenting Chat Widget

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'PREZENTING CHAT WIDGET'}>

```swift
LiveChat.presentChat()
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Setting Custom Variables

You can provide customer name or email if they are known, so a customer will not need to fill out the pre-chat survey:

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'CUSTOMER NAME OR EMAIL'}>

```swift
LiveChat.name = "iOS Widget Example"
LiveChat.email = "example@livechatinc.com"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

<div class="clear"></div>

If you want to associate some additional info with your customer, you can set up Custom Variables:

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'SETTING CUSTOM VARIABLES'}>

```swift
LiveChat.setVariable(withKey:"Variable name", value:"Some value")
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Assign chat to specific group

You can route your customers to specific group of agents by providing groupId. More information can be found in our [Help Center](https://www.livechat.com/help/dividing-live-chat-by-group/).

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'ASSIGN CHAT TO SPECIFIC GROUP'}>

```swift
LiveChat.groupId = "7"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Notifying the user about the agent's response

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'NOTIFY USER ABOUT RESPONSE OF THE AGENT'}>

```swift
class YOUR_CLASS_NAME : LiveChatDelegate { // Your class need to implement LiveChatDelegate protocol
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        LiveChat.licenseId = "YOUR_LICENSE_ID"
        LiveChat.delegate = self // Set self as delegate

        return true
    }

    func received(message: LiveChatMessage) {
        print("Received message: \(message.text)")
        // Handle message here
    }
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

You can notifiy your user about agent response if chat was minimized by the user. To handle the incoming messages, your class must implement `LiveChatDelegate` protocol and set itself as `LiveChat.delegate`.

### Handling URL

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'HANDLING URL'}>

```swift
func handle(URL: URL) {
    print("URL is \(URL.absoluteString)")
    // Handle URL here
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

By default, all links in chat messages are opened in Safari browser. To change this behavior you can use the `LiveChatDelegate` to handle URL's yourself.

### Sending files from device library

If you have file sharing enabled for the visitors, you should provide usage description by including `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`), `NSCameraUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Camera Usage Description`) and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`) keys in your `Info.plist` file to avoid crash on iOS 10 or higher. You can check `Info.plist` files in example projects.

## Sample Apps

Sample apps can be found in the `Examples` folder. Samples for both Swift and Objective-C are provided.

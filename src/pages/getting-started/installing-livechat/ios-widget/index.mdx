# Introduction

The LiveChat Widget for iOS allows the app users to contact the chat agents directly from a mobile application. The widget is very easy for developers to integrate into their existing iOS apps.

The source code and installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios).

Version 2.0 of the widget has several significant improvements over the previous version that
can be found [here](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios/tree/e615b6e10848ece7c255407a6fff8485a92700aa).

# User guide

You integrate LiveChat into your project manually or with a dependency manager.

## Requirements

- iOS 15.6+
- Swift 5
- Xcode 13.4+

## Installation

### Carthage

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to manage your dependencies, simply add 'livechat/chat-window-ios' to your `Cartfile`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'LIVECHAT/CHAT-WINDOW-IOS'}>

```bash
github "livechat/chat-window-ios" ~> 2.0.26
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

Make sure you have added `LiveChat.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have include it in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage your dependencies, simply add LiveChat to your `Podfile`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'LIVECHAT TO PODFILE'}>

```bash
pod 'LiveChat', '~> 2.0.26'
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Manual Installation

You can integrate iOS chat widget into your project manually without using a dependency manager.

#### Swift

Just drag all files from the `LiveChat/Sources` directory into your project.

#### Objective-C

Drag all files from the `LiveChat/Sources` directory into your project. When adding first `*.swift` file to Objective-C project, Xcode will ask you to create a Bridging Header. It is not necessary for chat widget to work, so you can decline unless you plan to call Swift code from Objective-C. More information about bridging headers and Swift and Objective-C interoperability can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html). You need to put the following import statement: `#import "<Your Project Name>-Swift.h"` at the top of your .m file.

Also, for Objective-C projects, you need to set the **Embedded Content Contains Swift Code** flag in your project to `Yes` (found under **Build Options** in the **Build Settings** tab).

## Usage

### Initalization

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'INITALIZATION'}>

```swift
import LiveChat

LiveChat.licenseId = "YOUR_LICENSE_ID"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Presenting Chat Widget

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'PRESENTING CHAT WIDGET'}>

```swift
LiveChat.presentChat()
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Presenting Chat Widget within client app view hierarchy

You can take control of the widget presentation in your app by setting the `customPresentationStyleEnabled` flag to `true`. This will disable the default presentation behavior, allowing you to manage it yourself.

With this flag enabled, you’ll have access to the `chatViewController` property to define your own presentation style.

When `customPresentationStyleEnabled` is set to `false`, then `chatViewController` has a value of `null`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'PREZENTING CHAT WIDGET WITHIN CLIENT APP VIEW'}>

```swift
class YOUR_CLASS_NAME : UIViewControler, LiveChatDelegate { // Your class needs to implement the LiveChatDelegate protocol

    @IBAction func openChat(_ sender: Any) {  
        LiveChat.delegate = self
        LiveChat.customPresentationStyleEnabled = true

        present(LiveChat.chatViewController!, animated: true) {
            print("Presentation completed")
        }
    }

    func chatDismissed() {
        LiveChat.chatViewController!.dismiss(animated: true) {
            print("Presentation dismissed")
        }
    }
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Using UIWindowSceneDelegate

If your app is using UIWindowScene API you need to perform additional configuration steps in your window scene delegate class.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'USING UIWINDOWSCENEDELEGATE'}>

```swift
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        LiveChat.windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene)
    }
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Setting Custom Variables

You can provide customer name or email if they are known, so a customer will not need to fill out the pre-chat survey:

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'CUSTOMER NAME OR EMAIL'}>

```swift
LiveChat.name = "iOS Widget Example"
LiveChat.email = "example@livechatinc.com"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

<div class="clear"></div>

If you want to associate some additional info with your customer, you can set up Custom Variables:

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'SETTING CUSTOM VARIABLES'}>

```swift
LiveChat.setVariable(withKey:"Variable name", value:"Some value")
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Assign chat to specific group

You can route your customers to specific group of agents by providing groupId. More information can be found in our [Help Center](https://www.livechat.com/help/dividing-live-chat-by-group/).

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'ASSIGN CHAT TO SPECIFIC GROUP'}>

```swift
LiveChat.groupId = "7"
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Notifying the user about the agent's response

You can notifiy your user about agent response if chat was minimized by the user. To handle the incoming messages, your class must implement `LiveChatDelegate` protocol and set itself as `LiveChat.delegate`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'NOTIFY USER ABOUT RESPONSE OF THE AGENT'}>

```swift
class YOUR_CLASS_NAME : LiveChatDelegate { // Your class needs to implement the LiveChatDelegate protocol
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        LiveChat.licenseId = "YOUR_LICENSE_ID"
        LiveChat.delegate = self // Set self as delegate

        return true
    }

    func received(message: LiveChatMessage) {
        print("Received message: \(message.text)")
        // Handle message here
    }
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

#### Sample message structure

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'SAMPLE MESSAGE STRUCTURE'}>

```swift
{
    author = {
        name = "Support Bot";
    };
    id = "QZ0X4O6PAV_3";
    messageType = newMessage;
    text = "I'm a HelpDesk Bot, here to assist you with any HelpDesk questions!";
    timestamp = 1632478822776;
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Handling chat window presence events

At the SDK level, you can also handle chat window presence events by implementing the `LiveChatDelegate` protocol and setting your class as `LiveChat.delegate`.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'HANDLE CHAT WINDOW PRESENCE EVENTS'}>

```swift
class YOUR_CLASS_NAME : LiveChatDelegate { // Your class needs to implement the LiveChatDelegate protocol
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        LiveChat.licenseId = "YOUR_LICENSE_ID"
        LiveChat.delegate = self // Set self as delegate

        return true
    }
    
    func chatPresented() {
        print("Chat presented")
        // Handle event here
    }
    
    func chatDismissed() {
        print("Chat dismissed")
        // Handle event here
    }    
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Handling URL

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'HANDLING URL'}>

```swift
func handle(URL: URL) {
    print("URL is \(URL.absoluteString)")
    // Handle URL here
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

By default, all links in chat messages are opened in Safari browser. To change this behavior you can use the `LiveChatDelegate` to handle URL's yourself.

### Handling chat window errors

The SDK will use this method to report unhandled widget errors.

<Code>
<CodeSample path={'HANDLING ERRORS'}>

```swift
func loadingDidFail(with errror: Error) {
    print("Chat loading failure \(errror)")
    // Handle error here
}
```

</CodeSample>
</Code>

### Sending files from device library

If you have file sharing enabled for the visitors, you should provide usage description by including `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`), `NSCameraUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Camera Usage Description`) and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`) keys in your `Info.plist` file to avoid crash on iOS 10 or higher. You can check `Info.plist` files in example projects.

## Third party integrations

### SnapCall

The LiveChat SDK includes built-in [SnapCall](https://snapcall.io) integration. To enable this feature, you’ll need to request microphone and camera permissions from the user by adding the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSCameraUsageDescription` keys to your `Info.plist` file.

## Sample Apps

Sample apps can be found in the `Examples` folder. Samples for both Swift and Objective-C are provided.

# Introduction

Installing LiveChat is simple and only takes a few minutes. Once installed, you’ll be able to talk to your customer’s right away.

1. Log in to your LiveChat account and go to **Settings** &rarr; **Channels** &rarr; [**Website**](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/code).
2. Click on **Install LiveChat code manually** and then **Copy code**.
3. Paste the code to your website’s source code before the `</body>` tag.

Once you’ve successfully added LiveChat code to your website, refresh the page. You should see a chat widget in the bottom right corner.
The Chat widget is now installed on a website.

Have any issues with the installation? Our Support Heroes can help (and are available 24⁄7).

LiveChat has a dedicated module to integrate with React-based single-page apps. All you have to do is to import the LiveChat component and put it in your render method:

<CodeSample>

```javascript
import LiveChat from 'react-livechat'
...

<LiveChat license={your_license_id} />
```

</CodeSample>

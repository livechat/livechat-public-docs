# Introduction

This document is a reference of integrations available in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. We offer connecting with various development tools to smooth out your workflow: from creating a repository directly from the Console's interface to connecitng with supported deployment services for a smooth coding experience.

# GitHub

Integration with GitHub allows you to link your appâ€™s source code with corresponding application in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. You can either create a new repository for your application or select one of the repositories you already have on your account.

When creating new app, you can bootstrap your repository using a dedicated application template: a sample application with examples of using our SDKs and CLIs.

## Connect your account with GitHub

To link GitHub repositories with your apps, you need to connect your <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> account with your GitHub profile. You can do this directly from <a href="https://platform.text.com/console/settings/integrations/github/status" target="_blank">your profile settings</a>.

To complete the connection, install and authorize `Text Platform | Developer Console` in your GitHub account so that we can access all or selected repositories of your choice.

## Link your app to a repository

When you connect your Developer profile with your GitHub account, you can start linking your apps to dedicated repositories.

Once your app is created, head to the Repository tab. In here, you'll be able to link your app with new or existing repository from GitHub. If you decide to create a completely new repository, you can select a custom application template with predefined configuration and sample code.

When an application is linked with a repository, you can conveniently access and edit your code in Visual Studio Code directly from the application view.

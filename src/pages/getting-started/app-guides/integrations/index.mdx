# Introduction

This document is a reference of integrations available in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. Connect with different development tools and streamline your workflow by creating repositories directly from the Console and integrating with supported deployment services (coming soon!).

# GitHub

Integration with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> allows you to link your appâ€™s source code to a corresponding application in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. The integration allows both for creating a new repository from scratch and selecting one of the already existing repositories from your GitHub account.

When creating a new app, you can bootstrap your repository with a dedicated template including a sample application code with examples of using our SDKs and CLIs.

## Connect your account with GitHub

To start linking GitHub repositories with your apps, you need to connect your <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> account with your GitHub profile. You can do this directly from <a href="https://platform.text.com/console/settings/integrations/github/status" target="_blank">your profile settings</a>.

  <img alt="LiveChat GitHub integration" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-github-integration-settings.png" width="1537px" height="851px"/>
  
</div>

To complete the connection, install and authorize `Text Platform | Developer Console` in your GitHub account so that we can access either all or only selected repositories of your choice.

## Link your app to a repository

To link your application to a repository, select the app you want to connect and open the Repository tab.

</div>

In this view, you can either link your app with a new GitHub repository or select an already existing one. If you decide to create a completely new repository, you can select a custom application template with predefined configuration settings and sample code.

</div>

When your application is linked with a repository, you can conveniently access and edit your app's contents in Visual Studio Code directly from the application view.

# Netlify and Vercel

Connecting your app with Netlify or Vercel deployment service makes your development cycles faster, collaborations are more streamlined, and many things that must be done manually are automated. In a few seconds, the seamless deployment management allows you to get the URL of our application and configure all the building blocks your app needs easier and quicker.

## Getting started

Having the [GitHub repository linked to your app](#github) in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />, select the app you want to connect and go to the **Deployment** tab. You need to decide which deployment service you choose. Both flows are just as simple, consisting of only a few steps.

</div>

## Link deployment to a chosen service

Now, you need to link deployment to one of the available deployment services, Netlify or Vercel. This step requires connecting your Developer Program account with your Netlify or Vercel profile. You'll be redirected to a chosen provider's website to authorize this operation. This permission allows your Developer Console application to create and manage sites (or projects if we refer to Vercel) in your Netlify or Vercel profile.  

<div style={{maxWidth: "1500px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Dev Console Link Deployment" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-link-deployment-new-site.png" width="1406px" height="750px"/>
  
</div>

ðŸ’¡ If you have more than one account or repository on your Netlify or Vercel account, you can choose which account and repository you want to give the permissions to.

## Connect your deployment service to your repo

When the connection is successful, you can choose whether to **Create a new site/project** or **Use an existing site/project**. This operation aims at connecting your Netlify or Vercel account to your repository.

<div style={{maxWidth: "1500px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Dev Console Link Deployment Netlify" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-link-deployment.png" width="1406px" height="750px"/>
  
</div>

If you use Netlify, click the **Link** button after creating your site or using the existing one. When the deployment in Netlify is created, it's time to connect your Netlify account to your app's repository. To do that, click the **Install** button in the **Install the Netlify GitHub app**.

<div style={{maxWidth: "1500px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Dev Console Link Deployment Netlify permission" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-deployment-almost-ready.png" width="1406px" height="750px"/>
  
</div>

If you use Vercel, you need to permit Vercel to access your repository before creating your project or using the existing one. Youâ€™ll be redirected to Vercel's website to authorize this connection. When itâ€™s done, you can link your deployment.

<div style={{maxWidth: "1500px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Dev Console Link Deployment Vercel" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-vercel-app-permission.png" width="1406px" height="750px"/>
  
</div>

## Check what Netlify or Vercel integration gives you

Your Deployment block is all set, and your app URL is available now. You have your Developer Console connected to the GitHub repository and to the Netlify or Vercel profile. Your GitHub account is also connected to the selected provider's account. You can go to the created site/project in Netlify or Vercel or open your app directly from the Console. You can also use the provided URL to add more building blocks to your app.

  <img alt="LiveChat Dev Console Deployment set" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/integrations/livechat-deployment-ready.png" width="1406px" height="750px"/>
  
</div>

# Check your integrations

If you want to ensure which integrations are currently made on your user account and if they work correctly, there's a unique space for that. It is placed under the **Settings** tab in the **Integrations** section. You can also install missing integrations directly from this place.

# Introduction

This document is a reference of integrations available in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. Connect with different development tools and streamline your workflow by creating repositories directly from the Console and integrating with supported deployment services (coming soon!).

# GitHub

Integration with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> allows you to link your appâ€™s source code to a corresponding application in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. The integration allows both for creating a new repository from scratch and selecting one of the already existing repositories from your GitHub account.

When creating a new app, you can bootstrap your repository with a dedicated template including a sample application code with examples of using our SDKs and CLIs.

## Connect your account with GitHub

To start linking GitHub repositories with your apps, you need to connect your <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> account with your GitHub profile. You can do this directly from <a href="https://platform.text.com/console/settings/integrations/github/status" target="_blank">your profile settings</a>.

</div>

To complete the connection, install and authorize `Text Platform | Developer Console` in your GitHub account so that we can access either all or only selected repositories of your choice.

## Link your app to a repository

To link your application to a repository, select the app you want to connect and open the Repository tab.

</div>

In this view, you can either link your app with a new GitHub repository or select an already existing one. If you decide to create a completely new repository, you can select a custom application template with predefined configuration settings and sample code.

</div>

When your application is linked with a repository, you can conveniently access and edit your app's contents in Visual Studio Code directly from the application view.

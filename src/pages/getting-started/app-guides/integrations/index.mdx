# Introduction

This document is a reference of integrations available in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. We offer connecting with different development tools to streamline your workflow, such as creating repositories directly from the Console or integrating with supported deployment services for a smoother coding experience.

# GitHub

Integration with GitHub allows you to link your app’s source code to the corresponding application in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. This integration offers two options: creating a new repository from scratch or selecting one of the already existing repositories on your GitHub account.

When creating a new app, you can bootstrap your repository using a dedicated application template: a sample application with examples of using our SDKs and CLIs.

## Connect your account with GitHub

To start linking GitHub repositories with your apps, you need to connect your <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> account with your GitHub profile. You can do this directly from <a href="https://platform.text.com/console/settings/integrations/github/status" target="_blank">your profile settings</a>.

</div>

To complete the connection, install and authorize `Text Platform | Developer Console` in your GitHub account so that we can access all or selected repositories of your choice.

## Link your app to a repository

To link your application to a repository, select the app you want to connect and open to the Repository tab.

In this view, you have the option to link your app with a new GitHub repository or select an already existing one. If you decide to create a completely new repository, you can select a custom application template with predefined configuration settings and sample code.

</div>

Once your application is linked with a repository, you can conveniently access and edit your app's contents in Visual Studio Code directly from the application view.

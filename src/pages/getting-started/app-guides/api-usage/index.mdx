# Introduction

API Usage is a tool where you’ll see all information about your API use. If you’re a paying API user, this will help you to understand your expenses and control which application or API takes up your resources.

# Reports

View detailed reports about your API usage. You can see a consolidated visual report for daily usage, with an additional representation for each API.

## Aggregated data

Aggregated data helps you see an hourly breakdown of your API requests. You’ll see the sources of the calls, the number of requests, and the API they were sent to.

## Raw data

Thanks to the raw data report, you’ll see even more detail on the sent requests — including the source and the exact method of the call. With this data, you’ll be able to easily pin down potential issues with your code and cut down on the expenses in your payments.

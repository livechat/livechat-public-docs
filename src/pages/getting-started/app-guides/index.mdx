## Introduction

**App guides** are a collection of **tutorials** created to help you navigate through <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> and **effectively use the tools** it provides to build applications for LiveChat and HelpDesk. If you're not familiar with Developer Console, it's your own developer portal, where you can build integrations that can be later on published on our <a href="https://www.livechat.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>.

Apart from the actual code of your application, you need to configure its funcionalities with building blocks. They allow you to connect your integration with the LiveChat or HelpDesk ecosystem, by, for example, **setting up authorization**, **choosing the integration placement**, or **configuring webhooks**.

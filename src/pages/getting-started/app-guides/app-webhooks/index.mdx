App webhooks allow you to keep track of how often your application is installed and uninstalled.

## Bulding block configuration

If you want to be notified about your app installation and uninstallation events, configure an App Webhooks building block in {{DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL}}. To do that, provide a URL to your backend that will receive the webhooks.

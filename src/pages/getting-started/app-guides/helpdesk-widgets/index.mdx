## Introduction

App Widgets are web apps loaded inside the HelpDesk Application. They live in iframes and can interact and communicate with the HelpDesk App. You can use them to:

- automate your processes and workflows.
- integrate external online services or applications.
- customize your views, reports, or payment methods.
- translate your messages or tickets.

## Building block configuration

There are three fields visible while Creating a HelpDesk Widget: **Widget source URL**, **Widget placement**, and **Opening state**.

**Widget source URL** is the address of your deployed application. You can also enter `https://localhost/` while you develop the app. If you don't have the code yet but want to play around, feel free to use our [sample apps](/extending-agent-app/agent-app-sdk/#sample-apps).

As for the **widget placement**, you can choose one of the following locations: the Details section, Fullscreen apps, or Settings. To create a Ticket Details widget, you need to edit all three required fields: Widget source URL, Widget placement, and Opening state. If you want to create Full Screen or App Settings widgets, only the Widget source URL and Widget placement fields are required. [Read more](/extending-agent-app/#app-locations) about app placements.

**Opening state** allows you to add components to your application and see a live preview of what the app will look like in the **Opening state preview**.

The components you may add are:

- [Header](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#header)
<!-- - [Item](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#item) -->
- [Button](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#button)
- [Label with value](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#label-with-value)
- [Link](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#link)
- [Divider](/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk#divider)

## Introduction

This document explains how to configure the **Chat Webhooks** building block in <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. It was written for everyone aiming to configure webhooks in their integrations **via user interface** instead of calling the LiveChat [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#webhooks) directly. The document assumes you're already familiar with the general idea of webhooks.

Keep in mind that the Chat Webhooks building block allows you to configure the `license` webhooks, and that is what this document focuses on. The document doesn't apply to the `bot` webhooks.

## Tutorial

This tutorial presents how to build a simple application with the Chat Webhooks building block. It also explains the configuration of all other parts that are required for the Chat Webhooks block to be functional. The tutorial applies to the new chat webhooks (v3.3 or later).

In short, you need to take the following steps:

1. [Create an app in Developer Console.](#step-1-create-an-app-in-developer-console)
2. [Configure authorization.](#step-2-configure-authorization)
3. [Configure chat webhooks.](#step-3-configure-chat-webhooks)

The end result of this tutorial will be an application that receives webhooks whenever a pre-determined event occurs.

### Before you start

Log in to <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" /> or create an account for free.

### Step 1: Create an app in Developer Console

To create a new app, all you need to do is click **Create new app+**, come up with a name, choose the product you want to build for, and click **Continue**.

Then, if your app has the frontend side, add and configure [the Agent App Widget building block](/extending-agent-app/agent-app-sdk/#getting-started). Skip this step if you're building a 100% backend app with no UI.

### Step 2: Configure authorization

Why is it necessary? You're building an application that, once installed, will call the Configuration API to enable webhooks for a user's license. To perform this operation, the user needs to authorize your application first.

#### Configure the App Authorization building block

Go to **Building blocks** and select **App Authorization**. You'll be asked about the client type: JavaScript app or server-side app. Applications that make use of webhooks are usually backend apps, so choose the server-side app.

- Provide a **Direct installation URL** and add it to the Redirect URI whitelist.

💡 Watch our [live coding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8YG9mLdfI) to learn more about the Direct installation flow or keep on reading.

#### Handle direct installation and authorization in your app

Usually, the authorization process starts in the LiveChat Agent Application when a user runs the app for the first time. With the **direct installation flow** enabled, authorization begins on the Marketplace. When a user installs your app, a pop-up with the LiveChat authorization flow appears, and the application asks for access to certain resources. Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to the **Direct installation URL**, where they can, for example, do the initial app configuration. (It all depends on what you implemented.)

As a developer, you need to handle the authorization flow in your app. For a backend app, we recommend [Authorization code grant](/authorization/authorizing-api-calls/#authorization-code-grant), where your app exchanges `code` for `token`.

### Step 3: Configure chat webhooks

Configuring chat webhooks in Developer Console is equivalent to calling the [Register Webhooks](/management/configuration-api/#register-webhook) method from the Configuration API. In both cases, all your registered webhooks will be automatically enabled for each license that installs your app and grants it access.

The configuration of the Chat Webhooks building block is a four-step process and involves the following aspects:

- [Webhook URL](#webhook-url)
- [Secret key](#secret-key)
- [Webhook type](#webhook-type)
- [Webhook triggers](#webhook-triggers)

  <img alt="LiveChat" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/chat-webhooks/livechat-webhook-configuration.png" width="831px" height="1024px"/>
</div>

Once a webhook is added, you won't be able to edit it. If you need to make any changes to its configuration, you’ll need to re-register the webhook with the new settings.

#### Webhook URL

All the webhooks will be sent to the URL you provide in the **Webhook URL** field. That's likely the address of your backend service, but you can use [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for testing. Each of added webhooks can be sent to a different URL.

#### Secret key

We'll include your **secret key** in the payload of each webhook. This way, your application can verify the webhooks came from us. Make sure you save the generated secret key as it will disappear after you refresh the page. If needed, you can always regenerate a new key or provide a custom one in the **Secret key** field.

#### Webhook type

You can select from two options: `license` or `bot` webhooks. Bot webhooks let you configure automated bots that react to specific events. This tutorial focuses on the `license` webhooks, but you can read more about `bot` webhooks in [this tutorial](https://platform.text.com/resource-center/updates/setting-up-livechat-bot-webhooks).

#### Webhook triggers

Then, choose the **webhook trigger**, the action that will cause sending a webhook to the Webhook URL every time a specific event occurs. For the majority of events, you can also select a filter.

<div style={{maxWidth:"700px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat webhooks" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/chat-webhooks/livechat-multiple-webhooks.png" width="666px" height="578px"/>
</div>

- [The list of available webhooks](/management/webhooks/#available-webhooks)
- [The list of webhook filters](/management/configuration-api/#triggering-actions)

You can add only one trigger per webhook, but you can add multiple webhooks in one Chat Webhooks block. Each of the webhooks has its own ID.

### End result

Thanks to such a setup, webhook will be automatically enabled for users who install your app from the Marketplace once it is published.

### Testing chat webhooks

To test your webhooks, go to the **Private installation** tab and click **Install app**. If you used **Direct installation URL**, you'll see a popup window displaying the contents from your app (This is the stage of receiving `code` that you need to exchange it for `token`.) In production-ready apps, your app should automatically close the window when authorizing a user. Then, perform the action that's your webhook trigger, for example, start a chat if you selected the `incoming_chat` webhook.

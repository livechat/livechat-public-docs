# Introduction

There are situations when your app is already published on our <Placeholder id="LIVECHAT_MARKETPLACE_URL"/> or <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">HelpDesk Marketplace</a>, but you decide it needs a change or improvement. To be able to introduce changes to your published app, you need to fork it and then replace the original app with the forked version. 

# Forking process

To start the forking process of your published app, you can choose between two options:

1. You need to go to the **Apps** tab on the left of your screen and click the burger menu button of the app you want to fork. Then, click the **Edit app** button to proceed with the forking process.
2. You need to go to the **Apps** tab on the left of your screen and click the app you want to fork. Next, click the **Manage App** button, pick the **Fork app** option, and follow the process.

<Warning>

**Credentials after forking an app**

The forked app will receive new authorization credentials. However, the original credentials (**Client Id** and **Client Secret**) will remain unchanged when the fork is published.
If your app uses <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/getting-started/app-guides/chat-webhooks" target="_blank">Chat Webhooks</a>, the **Secret Key** will also stay the same unless a different one is given in one of the two Security update modals appearing during the forking process.

</Warning>

When forking is done, you can introduce all the necessary changes. After that, go to the **Private Installation** tab and install your app on your license to test it. When everything is how you want it to be, go to the **Publish on Marketplace** tab and submit your fork app for review. When our team approves it, publish it on the Marketplace, and enjoy your new app with the introduced changes.

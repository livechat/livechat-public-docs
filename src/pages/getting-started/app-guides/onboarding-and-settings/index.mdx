Onboarding & Settings is a building block created to help you with the successful onboarding of your app users. Also, this block allows you to define app settings, where the users will be able to configure your application.

# Building block configuration

## Onboarding

Sometimes, despite good UX patterns in the app, the initial setup is a bit more complicated. As a result, some users might get lost, frustrated, or even drop out and uninstall the app. To prevent that from happening, you can use three ways to onboard your app users:

- [Setup completion endpoint](#setup-completion-endpoint)
- [Onboarding guidelines](#onboarding-guidelines)
- [Tutorial URL](#tutorial-url)

### Setup completion endpoint

Setup completion endpoint is unique for your application. Call the endpoint to inform us that a user hasn’t completed the app setup after the installation (for example, didn’t connect with a third-party service). Thanks to this info, **we’ll be able to remind the user to finish the configuration next time they visit your app page on the Marketplace.**

You can use HTTP PUT and DELETE methods. Use PUT to add a user whom you want to remind about app configuration, and make a DELETE call when a user has completed the setup and no longer needs the reminder.

<CodeSample path={'Sample PUT request to the /setup endpoint'}>

```bash
curl -X PUT 'https://dev-platform.livechatinc.com/v2/applications/15jS39tMg/instance/setup' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
```

</CodeSample>

 This functionality requires the [App Authorization block](/getting-started/app-guides/app-authorization). You should call `/setup` with the `access token` of the user who gave their permission to your app.

### Onboarding guidelines

Another way of educating your app users is including onboarding guidelines. You can write them in markdown directly in Developer Console. We'll show them on your app page on the Marketplace to those users who installed your app and in your app settings in the LiveChat application.

Go through the following list and see what kind of information you might want to include in your guidelines:

- What to do/where to go after the app installation.
- Any required registration with a third-party service.
- Providing user credentials, such as API keys, phone numbers, etc.

### Tutorial URL

Provide the URL to your app tutorial. It can have the form of written instructions or a video – it's up to you. If there's any advanced configuration users need to complete, include it in the tutorial, preferably presented in a step-by-step manner.

## Settings

Many applications come with settings necessary to configure or customize the app. From the UX perspective, the best way to present your app settings is in the Settings tab of the LiveChat application. This is where users will intuitively go when searching for configuration options.

### Settings URL

All you need to do is provide us with the URL to your settings page, and we'll display this page to users right in the LiveChat application.

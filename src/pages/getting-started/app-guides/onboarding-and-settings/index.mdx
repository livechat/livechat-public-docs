Onboarding & Settings is a building block helping you with the successful onboarding of your app users. Also, this block allows you to define app settings, where the users will be able to configure your application.

# Building block configuration

## Onboarding

Sometimes, despite good UX patterns in the app, the initial setup is a bit more complicated and, as a result, some users get lost, frustrated, or even drop out and uninstall the app. To prevent that from happening, you can use three ways to onboard your app users:

- [Setup completion endpoint](#setup-completion-endpoint)
- [Onboarding guidelines](#onboarding-guidelines)
- [Tutorial URL](#tutorial-url)

### Setup completion endpoint

Setup completion endpoint is unique for your application. Call the endpoint it to inform us that a user hasn’t completed the app setup after the installation (for example, didn’t connect with a third-party service). Thanks to this info, **we’ll be able to remind the user to finish the configuration next time they visit your app page on the Marketplace.**

You can use HTTP PUT and DELETE methods. This functionality requires the [App Authorization block](/getting-started/app-guides/app-authorization).

<CodeSample path={'Sample PUT request to the setup completion endpoint'}>

```bash
curl https://dev-platform.livechatinc.com/v2/applications/0Qa7qSmnR/instance/setup
```

</CodeSample>

### Onboarding guidelines

Another way of educating your app users is including onboarding guidelines. You can write them in markdown directly in Developer Console. We'll displayed them on your app page on the Marketplace and in the settings of your app in the LiveChat application.

Go thorugh the following list and see what kind of inromation you might ant to include in your guidelines:

- What to do/where to go after the app installation.
- Any required registration with a third-party service.
- Providing user credentials, such as API keys, phone numbers, etc.

# Introduction

This document explains how to configure the Properties building block in the Developer Console. It was written for everyone aiming to configure properties in their integrations via user interface instead of calling the LiveChat Configuration API directly. The document assumes you're already familiar with the general idea of properties. If not, we encourage you to see the following resources:

- <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/updates/livechat-properties/" target="_blank">Properties: what they are and how to configure them with LiveChat API v3.3+</a>
- [Properties in the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#properties/)

# Building block configuration

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure the Properties building block, you need to complete the following steps:

- Have an account in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />.
- Create an app for which you'll create properties. If you don't know how to create an app, [here's the tutorial](/getting-started/livechat-apps/#creating-livechat-apps).
- Add the  `properties--configuration:rw` scope in the App Authorization building block. This scope allows for creating and editing properties.

## Creating a new property

The Developer Console makes it possible to create properties via user interface instead of calling the [Register Property](/management/configuration-api/#register-property) method directly. LiveChat properties are registered per application (Client ID). An application that owns a property (property configuration/definition, not a specific property value) is the owner Client ID.

To create a new property, you'll need to configure the following fields:

### Property name

- This is a required parameter.

### Property type

- This is a required parameter.
- It defines what type of data can be stored in a property.
- You can choose between `int`, `string`, `bool`, and `tokenized_string`.

### Property location

- This is a required parameter.
- It defines in what data structure(s) a property will be available.
- You can choose from **chat, thread, event, license, group**, and it's possible to select them all. This will make the property available in all locations.

#### Access

For each chosen location, you need to define the access type for both agents and customers. Unless you publish your property, these access rules will apply only to the owner Client ID.

<div style={{maxWidth: "500px", marginBottom: "10px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Property Location" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/properties/livechat-properties-location.png" width="1022px" height="1078px"/>
</div>

This is how the selected options would be represented in the property object:

```json
{
  "name": "sample_property",
  "access": {
    "chat": {
      "agent": ["read", "write"],
      "customer": ["read"]
      },
    "thread": {
      "agent": ["read", "write"],
      "customer": ["read"]
    }
  }
}
```

💡 If you already know that you'll publish your property and that you'd like customers of other apps to be able to **write** to your property, you need to include the `write` access for customers at this stage.

### Property domain

- This is an optional parameter.
- You can choose between the following options:
  - an explicit set of values, for example, `poor,good,excellent` or `2,4,8,16`
  - a range of integer values, for example, `1-100`

<div style={{maxWidth: "800px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Property Domain" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/properties/livechat-properties-domain.png" width="2019px" height="352px"/>
</div>

### Property default value

- This is an optional parameter.
- It can be set up only for license and group properties.
- It has to match the property domain or range if either is defined.

## Publishing properties

Creating a property in the Developer Console registers it in the Configuration API. By default, all properties are created [private](/management/configuration-api#private-properties), which means they're accessible only to the owner Client ID. Publishing a property makes it available to other applications, opening up more advanced integration possibilities.

<Warning>

💡 Keep in mind that property publication is irreversible. Also, once published, a property cannot be deleted.

</Warning>

During property publishing, you need to determine the access level for other applications (other than the owner Client ID). You can choose `read` and/or `write`. This access type will apply to agents and customers of other applications based on what you've chosen during property creation.

<div style={{maxWidth: "800px", marginBottom: "10px"}}>
  <img alt="LiveChat Property publishing" src="/images/getting-started/app-guides/properties/livechat-properties-publishing.png" width="1652px" height="1014px"/>
</div>

For example, when you choose the `read` and `write` access types during property publishing, only agents will be granted both access types. Customers will only have the `read` access as this is what was defined during property configuration. ([See the code snippet](#access)). The access rules for the owner Client ID stay unchanged.

## Editing properties

It's impossible to edit an already created properties, even the private ones. What you can do instead is delete and recreate them. Deleting a private property will [unregister it](/management/configuration-api#unregister-property) in the Configuration API under the hood.

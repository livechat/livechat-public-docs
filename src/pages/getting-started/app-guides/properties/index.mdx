# Introduction

This document explains how to configure the Properties building block in the Developer Console. It was written for everyone aiming to configure properties in their integrations via user interface instead of calling the LiveChat Configuration API directly. The document assumes you're already familiar with the general idea of properties. If not, we encourage you to see the following resources:

- <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/updates/livechat-properties/" target="_blank">Properties: what they are and how to configure them with LiveChat API v3.3+</a>
- [Properties in the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/#properties/)

# Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to configure the Properties building block in the Developer Console.

There are three major steps in this process:

1. [Creating an app](#step-1-create-an-app)
2. [Configuring app authorization](#step-2-configure-app-authorization)
3. [Configuring properties](#step-3-configure-properties)

The end result of the process will be an application with registered properties.

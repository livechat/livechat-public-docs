# Introduction

Our APIs are a premium solution. This allows us to offer a partnership with developers who decide to build apps for the <a href="https://www.text.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Text Marketplace</a>. Our APIs are available for a fee for private solutions that aren't available for other users.

# For public apps

Developers who have a public application or are working on one won’t be charged for the API usage of these apps. The APIs are paid only for private solutions unavailable on the <a href="https://www.text.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Text Marketplace</a> and calls made with Personal Access Tokens.

# For private use

When you choose to build a private solution or use Personal Access Tokens, our APIs are available for a fee. To understand the pricing details and costs associated with using our APIs for private projects, you’ll be charged depending on the amount of resources you use.

The billing for all private solutions that aren't published the Marketplace is as follows:

| Private use: 0-1M requests / month | Private use: 1M-10M requests / month | Private use: +10M requests / month | Public apps        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| $0.27 / 1000 requests              | $0.22 / 1000 requests                | $0.17 / 1000 requests              | $0 / 1000 requests |

## Common questions

For detailed information about the API pricing and rules, refer to this FAQ:

### Which APIs are billed?

We'll charge you for requests made to all of our available APIs and SDKs. Any private interaction with our API ecosystem counts toward your paid requests.

### Will I need to pay for the APIs if I have published an app on the Text Marketplace?

We won’t charge you for calls made from your public apps, but we will bill you for any calls made from private apps or Personal Access Tokens.

### Do I need to pay for the API if I’m currently in the process of building an app I want to publish on the Marketplace?

No, you will not need to pay for the API use of apps you’re building for the Marketplace. In case you run out of free API access, reach out to us so we can discuss an individual approach.

### Do all of the APIs cost the same price per request?

Yes, each API has the same price per request.

### Can I set a request limit for my organization?

No, there’s currently no option to set a limit on sent requests.

### Is there a threshold of free requests?

Upon creating your account, you’ll receive a one-time topup of $5 to spend on API requests. Once you spend that amount, we’ll start charging you for all further requests according to our API pricing.

### Do I also pay for failed requests?

We charge for all requests sent to our API apart from the requests with a `500` response status.

### How often will I get charged?

We’ll be issuing you a monthly invoice by the end of each month.

### How will I be charged?

The charges will be collected automatically from your linked credit card.

### Where will I be able to access my invoice?

You’ll find your invoices in the LiveChat Billing section and in the Developer Console. They will also be sent via email to the owner of the organization.

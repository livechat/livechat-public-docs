# Introduction

Our APIs are a premium solution. This allows us to offer a partnership with developers who decide to build apps for the <a href="https://www.text.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Text Marketplace</a>. Our APIs are available for a fee for users who decide not to share their products outside their licenses.

# For developers

Developers who already have a published application, are working on one, or intend to build one soon won’t be charged for their API usage. The APIs are paid only for developers who do not have or intend to build an application for the <a href="https://www.text.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Text Marketplace</a>.

# For private users

When you choose to build private solutions, our APIs are available for a fee. To understand the pricing details and costs associated with using our APIs for private projects, you’ll be charged depending on the amount of resources you use.

The billing for users who decide to build only private solutions and not share them on the Marketplace is as follows:

| Private users: 0-75K requests / month | Private users: 75K-10M requests / month | Private users: +10M requests / month | Marketplace developers |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| $0.014 / 1000 requests                   | $0.012 / 1000 requests                     | $0.008 / 1000 requests                | $0 / 1000 requests     |

Currently billed APIs are:

- [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api)
- [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api)
- [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api)
- [Reports API](/data-reporting/reports-api)
- [Webhooks](/management/webhooks)

## Common questions

For detailed information about the API pricing and rules, refer to this FAQ:

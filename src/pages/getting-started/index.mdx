# Welcome to Platform

If you're wondering whether the Platform would suit your business, this is where you can get started. We'd like to tell you about our products, their main functionalities, and their high potential to be customized. Let's take you on a small tour!

# What Text is about 

<a href="https://text.com/" target="_blank">Text</a> enables entrepreneurs to build technology that provides better customer service apps and helps them reach new audiences. Text products are used by more than <Placeholder id="NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS" /> companies in over 150 countries.

The Text Platform is an ecosystem for developers that grew mainly, but not only, around two Text products, <a href="https://www.livechat.com/" target="_blank">LiveChat</a> and <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/" target="_blank">HelpDesk</a>. 
From a more tech perspective, the Platform provides:

- open messaging protocol with real-time and web APIs
- rich messaging tools and chatbots
- reporting and data extraction APIs
- management and configuration APIs
- monetization tools and <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/>
- autorization tools

# Meet LiveChat

**LiveChat** helps you handle conversations with the customers who visit your websites. Customers can start chats with your agents, but it can also be the other way round. Your agents can initiate chats, making your visitors feel welcome and valued. If you're up to some automation, you can engage them in a conversation with <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/targeted-messages/" target="_blank">targeted messages</a>. Also, delegating some work to <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/chatbots-explained/" target="_blank">bots</a> is an option when running a business on a bigger scale.

Your customers can start multiple conversations with agents, as well as continue the existing ones - it's up to them. Keeping track of chat history is easy, as agents can scroll up to get a preview of all the exchanged messages in a conversation.

All of these functionalities are guaranteed _out of the box_, but this is just a tiny bit of what LiveChat offers. If you're interested in other default features, see the <a href="https://www.livechat.com/features/" target="_blank">full list of LiveChat features</a>.

## What LiveChat can be
  
We're constantly trying to come forward with the new ways customers could integrate with LiveChat. Certain business needs call for specific customization, whether it's creating an app or just tweaking the look & feel.

### Extending LiveChat

LiveChat can extend its interface by building apps to add new panels, widgets, and UI elements. When integrating with the Agent App, developers can choose from various options. All options were designed to extend different app locations, making it very flexible. Our Platform offers, for example, apps in the Details section (widgets), fullscreen apps displayed in the main menu, or apps in the Customer Details section (Customer Detail widgets). <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app" target="_blank">Learn more...</a> The <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/agent-app-sdk" target="_blank">Agent App SDK</a> is currently the primary way to develop your own widgets.

Just as there are ways to build upon the App, there are also some to extend the [Chat Widget](#chat-widget) using <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/javascript-api/" target="_blank">Chat Widget JavaScript API</a> or <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/customer-sdk/" target="_blank">Chat Widget Customer SDK</a>.

Besides extending LiveChat UI, you can also develop LiveChat using our [Messaging](#messaging) and [Management](#management) APIs or by [interacting with data](#interacting-with-data).

### Monetizing your LiveChat app

After building your LiveChat app, personalizing it, and fitting it to your customers' needs, you can [monetize](#monetization) it and place it on our <Placeholder id="LIVECHAT_MARKETPLACE_URL"/> to reach many potential customers and gain some profit.

# Meet HelpDesk

## What HelpDesk can be

As the Platform tries to follow the needs of our developers so they can build a wide range of integrations that perfectly fit their customers, you can extend HelpDesk in many different areas.

### Extending HelpDesk

The first and definitely most fun way to extend HelpDesk is by playing with its interface. It can be done by adding widgets and placing them in many different locations of your app. You can choose one of the following placements: the Details section, Fullscreen apps, or Settings (<a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app" target="_blank">Learn more...</a>). The <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app/products-sdk/helpdesk-sdk" target="_blank">HelpDesk SDK</a> is currently the primary way to develop your own widgets.

You can also let users sign in to your service via <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat#accounts-sdk" target="_blank">Accounts SDK</a> or automate various tasks using [HelpDesk APIs](#helpdesk-api).

### HelpDesk API

When you build HelpDesk applications with our Platform, they may need to use our <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs" target="_blank">HelpDesk API</a>. To allow you to play with it and discover its potential, which is developed in many useful areas, HelpDesk API is fully available. You can experiment with:

 -  <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#tag/Agents" target="_blank">Account and users</a>
 -  <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#tag/Tickets" target="_blank">Tickets</a>
 -  <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#tag/Email-domains" target="_blank">Managing your emails</a>
 -  <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#tag/Canned-responses" target="_blank">Automating your work</a>
 -  <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#tag/Reports" target="_blank">Analyzing your reports</a>

### Monetize HelpDesk apps

Our Platform provides you also with [monetization tools](#monetization) that can help you gain profit for the created integrations and publish them on the <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">HelpDesk Marketplace</a>.

ðŸ’¡ If you want to read about building HelpDesk apps, go to our <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/getting-started/helpdesk-apps" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.

# Authorization

LiveChat and HelpDesk use OAuth 2.1 protocol to <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization" target="_blank">authenticate and authorize</a> their services. 
<a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/authorizing-api-calls" target="_blank">API authorization flows</a> are divided into <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/agent-authorization" target="_blank">agent</a> and <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/customer-authorization" target="_blank">customer</a> authorization flows. Each app functionality requires different <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/scopes" target="_blank">scopes</a> to be configured in <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/>.

To access basic information in LiveChat and HelpDesk accounts, you will use <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat" target="_blank">Accounts SDK (Sign in with LiveChat)</a>, which is the simplest way to do that.

Platform also provides you with with a <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/global-accounts" target="_blank">Global Accounts service</a> which is very useful for customers who use <a href="https://www.chatbot.com/" target="_blank">ChatBot</a>, <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/" target="_blank">HelpDesk</a>, or <a href="https://www.knowledgebase.com/" target="_blank">KnowledgeBase</a>. It allows customers to configure standard options and resources across all products.

# Dveloper Console tools

If you want to save time while building your app and don't want to play with APIs, <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/> comes with a helping hand to provide easy access to all tools and resources for developers who want to build their apps. It is a place where you can configure your applications, set up their most crucial functions and create all the necessary extensions. The simplest way to create a paid app or display your app on the Marketplace is within the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/>.

<Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/> is rich in many helpful functions that will help make your app efficient, valuable, and attractive for potential customers.

# Messaging

Many LiveChat applications built upon the Platform need to use our API. For that reason, we make it accessible and let developers play with it. You can choose between:

- [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/)
- [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api/)

Together, the [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/) and the [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api/) create the <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging" target="_blank">Messaging APIs</a>. It is a full set of methods to use either as an agent or as a customer. We divide it though, to make it more use-case-specific. The distinction is intuitive; when you want to join a chat as an agent, use the Agent Chat API. To interact as a customer, use the Customer Chat API. 

These two sets of APIs are very versatile. The Agent Chat API lets you build your custom Agent App, as well as browser chat archives, or ban customers. With the use of the Customer Chat API, you can build a custom Chat Widget. Both APIs allow for interactions, such as joining a chat, posting messages, etc.

If Messaging APIs seem overwhelming, or you don't have time to play with them, <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/chat-sdk" target="_blank">Chat SDK</a> comes to help you. It was designed to allow developers to build apps quickly. It comes with a method template for sending plain text messages. Based on that method, you can easily build new methods.

Platform also provides two Software Development Kits, <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/go-sdk" target="_blank">LiveChat Go SDK</a>, written in Go, and <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/js-sdk" target="_blank">LiveChat JS SDK</a>, written in Typescript. They are tools for developers to build external backend apps which extend LiveChat features. The SDKs make it easy to use the [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/), the [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api/), and the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/).

# Management

The <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/management" target="_blank">Configuration API</a> is a service for storing license configurations. It can be used to build complex integrations or to configure resources directly via the API.

Configuration API allows:

- Properties setup to store information about chats or events.
- Webhooks management to connect LiveChat with different services and react immediately to the things happening in the chat.
- Bot agents configuration to connect LiveChat with AI solutions.

# Interacting with data

One of the most extensively used section in the Agent App is <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/reporting-options-available-in-livechat/" target="_blank">Reports</a>. We provide several types of reports, which help managers with the analysis. You can measure chat satisfaction and duration, keep track of agents' activity, or compare time periods to observe trends. 

Again, this is just a tiny bit of what's available in terms of reporting. Yet, we're aware that what we offer does not cover every single business case. This is where [Reports API](/data-reporting/reports-api/) comes into play. It serves as a sets of tools to create apps which interact on the server side. With this API, it's possible to design exactly what you need.

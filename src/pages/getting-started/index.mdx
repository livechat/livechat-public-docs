# Welcome to Platform

If you're wondering whether the Platform would suit your business, this is where you can get started. We'd like to tell you about our products, their main functionalities, and their high potential to be customized. Let's take you on a small tour!

# What Text is about 

<a href="https://text.com/" target="_blank">Text</a> enables entrepreneurs to build technology that provides better customer service apps and helps them reach new audiences. Text products are used by more than <Placeholder id="NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS" /> companies in over 150 countries. The Platform is an ecosystem for developers that grew mainly, but not only, around two Text products, <a href="https://www.livechat.com/" target="_blank">LiveChat</a> and <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/" target="_blank">HelpDesk</a>.

# Meet LiveChat

**LiveChat** helps you handle conversations with the customers who visit your websites. Customers can start chats with your agents, but it can also be the other way round. Your agents can initiate chats, making your visitors feel welcome and valued. If you're up to some automation, you can engage them in a conversation with <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/targeted-messages/" target="_blank">targeted messages</a>. Also, delegating some work to <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/chatbots-explained/" target="_blank">bots</a> is an option when running a business on a bigger scale.

Your customers can start multiple conversations with agents, as well as continue the existing ones - it's up to them. Keeping track of chat history is easy, as agents can scroll up to get a preview of all the exchanged messages in a conversation.

All of these functionalities are guaranteed _out of the box_, but this is just a tiny bit of what LiveChat offers. If you're interested in other default features, see the <a href="https://www.livechat.com/features/" target="_blank">full list of LiveChat features</a>.

From a more tech perspective, the Platform provides:

- open messaging protocol with real-time and web APIs
- rich messaging tools and chatbots
- reporting and data extraction APIs
- management and configuration APIs
- monetization tools and <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL"/>
- the <Placeholder id="LIVECHAT_MARKETPLACE_URL"/> of apps and services

## What LiveChat can be
  
We're constantly trying to come forward with the new ways customers could integrate with LiveChat. Certain business needs call for specific customization, whether it's creating an app or just tweaking the look & feel. Currently, you can extend LiveChat in the below areas:

- <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app" target="_blank">LiveChat UI</a> 
- <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/getting-started/livechat-apps" target="_blank">Building LiveChat Apps Tutorial</a>
- [Platform APIs](#platform-apis)
- [Interacting with data](#interacting-with-data)

## Extending the LiveChat UI

One of the paths is to extend user interfaces. We provide developers with tools to modify the Agent App, as well as the Chat Widget interface.

When integrating with the Agent App, developers can choose from a variety of options. They were designed to extend different locations of the Agent App making the whole application very flexible. Our Platform offers, for example, apps in the Details section (widgets), fullscreen apps displayed in the main menu, or apps in the Customer Details section (Customer Detail widgets). <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app" target="_blank">Learn more...</a>

Just as there are ways to build upon the Agent App, there are also some to extend the Chat Widget. First of all, you could use <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/javascript-api/" target="_blank">Chat Widget JavaScript API</a> to alter the look and behavior of the Chat Widget. If that's not enough, building a new Chat Widget from scratch is possible with the <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/customer-sdk/" target="_blank">Chat Widget Customer SDK</a>.

# Meet HelpDesk

You can, e.g., connect your HelpDesk to an external tool or service, extend HelpDesk user interface, let users sign in to your service via Accounts SDK, or automate various tasks. Our Platform provides you also with <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/monetization" target="_blank">monetization tools</a> that can help you gain profit for the created integrations and publish them on the <a href="https://www.helpdesk.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">HelpDesk Marketplace</a>.

# Platform APIs

Many LiveChat and HelpDesk applications built upon the LiveChat Platform need to use our API. For that reason, we make it accessible and let developers play with it.

There are two **messaging APIs** for LiveChat:

- [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/)
- [Customer Chat API](/messaging/customer-chat-api/)

There's also the [Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/).

Public API for HelpDesk is widely described in the <a href="https://api.helpdesk.com/docs#section/Introduction" target="_blank">HelpDesk API Documentation</a>.

## Chat API

Together, the **Agent Chat API** and the **Customer Chat API** create the **Chat API**. It is a full set of methods to use either as an agent or as a customer. We divide it though, to make it more use-case-specific. The distinction is intuitive; when you want to join a chat as an agent, use the Agent Chat API. To interact as a customer, use the Customer Chat API.

These two sets of APIs are very versatile. The Agent Chat API lets you build your custom Agent App, as well as browser chat archives, or ban customers. With the use of the Customer Chat API, you can build a custom Chat Widget. Both APIs allow for interactions, such as joining a chat, posting messages, etc.

## Configuration API

The **Configuration API** is a service for storing license configurations. It allows for properties setup, webhooks management, and bot agents configuration.

# Interacting with data

One of the most extensively used section in the Agent App is <a href="https://www.livechat.com/help/reporting-options-available-in-livechat/" target="_blank">Reports</a>. We provide several types of reports, which help managers with the analysis. You can measure chat satisfaction and duration, keep track of agents' activity, or compare time periods to observe trends. Again, this is just a tiny bit of what's available in terms of reporting. Yet, we're aware that what we offer does not cover every single business case. This is where [Reports API](/data-reporting/reports-api/) comes into play. It serves as a sets of tools to create apps which interact on the server side. With this API, it's possible to design exactly what you need.

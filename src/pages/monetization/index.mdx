# Introduction

Text Platform provides you with a variety of monetization tools. Depending on your use case, you can simply set a price for your LiveChat or HelpDesk app or build more advanced payment flows. All the payments are processed within the Platform eco-system. You don't need any additional service or payment processor to start monetizing your apps.

## Paid apps

You can create a paid app right within the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. It's the simplest way to generate revenue from apps installed by LiveChat or HelpDesk customers.

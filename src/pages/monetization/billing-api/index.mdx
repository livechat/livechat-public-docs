# Introduction

The Text Billing API allows you to charge for your apps in [Text marketplaces](https://platform.text.com/docs/getting-started/#what-text-is-about). Therefore, you can offer paid applications to over <Placeholder id="NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS" /> Text customers.

The Billing API is a collective name for a subset of smaller APIs used for specific purposes (see the [APIs section](#2-apis) below for details).

## Overview

### Product support

The Billing API supports apps created for two of our products: LiveChat and HelpDesk. Support for more products is coming.

### Payment types

The Billing API supports the following payment types:

- **Direct charges** – one-time payments
- **Recurring charges** – subscription payments
- **Checkout link charges** - redirecting the user to the Marketplace checkout

### Additional options

It also handles a set of features to facilitate the payment and accounting processes:

- credit card processing
- invoices

<aside class="note">
  The customers can use their existing credit card from their Text account;
  there’s no need to re-renter the card details.

# Getting started

## Example app

<!-- ### Billing Demo app

A sample front-end app that implements Billing API to offer in-app payments.

It's available on GitHub: [https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo](https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo) -->

### Agent App Widget

A sample LiveChat [Agent App Widget](/extending-ui/extending-agent-app/agent-app-sdk/) that offers in-app payment using Billing API.

It's available on GitHub: [https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo-agent-app-extension](https://github.com/livechat/billing-demo-agent-app-extension)

# User guide

## 1. Authorization

The Billing API is based on the [Text OAuth](https://platform.text.com/docs/authorization/) authorization flow. All endpoints require access tokens, and some endpoints are limited by scope or client ID.

## 2. APIs

The current version of the Billing API is `v2`. This version makes it possible to handle various products, with the support of two of them already available: LiveChat and HelpDesk.
The product information is put explicitly in API endpoints - as the `<product>` element of each path.

### 2.1. Direct Charges

The Direct Charges API allows you to collect one-time fees.

#### Use cases

- Collecting a single charge for an application in the Marketplace
- Collecting in-app micropayments
- Charging for additional features in the apps

### 2.2. Ledger

The Ledger API lets you manage the financial activity and balance. In other words, it will show you the purchase history and your earnings.

#### Use cases

- Checking the balance
- Checking the billing history

### 2.3. Recurrent Charges

The Recurrent Charges API handles periodic payments. For example, you can offer an app that costs $10 per month.

#### Use cases

- Viewing the subscriptions
- Updating the subscriptions

## 3. External checkout link

Using the Billing API methods, you can create an external checkout link for your customers to complete the payment with. You can use it to include a convenient payment option, for example, in your mailing campaigns.

# Direct charges

The Direct Charges API is a tool to collect one-time payments.

## Statuses

There are six possible direct charge statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending`   | the charge has been created and is awaiting user interaction |
| `accepted`  | the charge has been accepted by the user                     |
| `declined`  | the charge has been declined by the user                     |
| `processed` | the charge is being processed by a payment gateway           |
| `failed`    | the charge could not be collected                            |
| `success`   | the charge has been collected                                |

## Flows

There are three possible direct charge flows:

- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `failed`
- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `success`
- `pending` -> `declined`

## Usage

- Create a charge for a user (`POST /v2/direct_charge/<product>`) and redirect them to the `confirmation_url`.
- After the user confirms or declines the charge, they will be redirected to `return_url` with charge `id` passed as a URL param.
- Based on `id`, you can check charge status (`GET /v2/direct_charge/<product>/:ID`). If it is `accepted`, you must activate the charge (`PUT /v2/direct_charge/<product>/:ID/activate`).
- After a while, our payment gateway will try to charge the user and it will automatically change the charge status to `success` or `failed`.

## Scopes

Direct Charges API requires `billing_manage` (for LiveChat) or `billing--all:rw` (for HelpDesk) scope for all endpoints.

If you want to use this API, you must create an app in Developer Console and check **"billing_manage"** or **"billing--all:rw"** scope (depending on the product) in the app settings. After successful authorization (by using Sign in with LiveChat), you will get an access token with the correct scope.

## Endpoints

Base URL: `https://billing.livechatinc.com`

- `POST /v2/direct_charge/<product>` - create a new charge. Required fields: `name`, `price`, `quantity`, `return_url`. Optional fields: `per_account`, `test`
- `GET /v2/direct_charge/<product>/:ID` - get an existing charge.
- `GET /v2/direct_charge/<product>` - create a paginated charges list (20 items per page) ordered by the creation date. Optional fields: `page`, `status`, `recurrent_charge_id`
- `PUT /v2/direct_charge/<product>/:ID/activate` - activate a charge (the payment gateway starts processing it).

# Ledger

The Ledger API handles the financial activity and balance.
Only supports LiveChat product for now.

## Entry object types

- `collection` - the amount has beed added
- `refund` - the amount has been deducted
- `withdrawal` - the amount has been paid off

## Scopes

Ledger API requires `ledger_read` scope for all endpoints.

If you want to use this API, you must create an app in Developer Console and check **"ledger_read"** scope in the app settings. After successful authorization (by using Sign in with LiveChat), you will get an access token with `ledger_read` scope.

## Endpoints

Base URL: `https://billing.livechatinc.com`

- `GET /v2/ledger/livechat` - returns the current ledger. It lists up to 20 entries, use `?page=X` for pagination. Required format: `{result: [LEDGER ENTRY 1, LEDGER ENTRY 2, ...]}`,
- `GET /v2/ledger/livechat/balance` - returns the current ledger balance in cents. Format: `{"balance": 10}`

# Recurrent charges

The Recurrent Charges API handles periodic payments. Once the payment is set up, a customer will be charged every month.

## Statuses

There are six possible recurrent charge statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`   | the charge has been created and is awaiting merchant interaction |
| `accepted`  | the charge has been accepted by the merchant                     |
| `declined`  | the charge has been declined by the merchant                     |
| `active`    | the charge is being processed by a payment gateway               |
| `frozen`    | the charge could not be collected                                |
| `cancelled` | the charge has been cancelled                                    |

## Flows

There are three possible recurrent charge flows:

- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `active` -> `cancelled`
- `pending` -> `accepted` -> `processed` -> `active` -> `frozen`

- `billing_admin` - for creating charges for other clients

## Endpoints

All endpoints return a recurrent charge object.

- `POST /v2/recurrent_charge/<product>` - create a new charge. Required fields: `name`, `price`, `return_url`. Optional fields: `external_id`, `test`, `trial_days`, `months`, `per_account`

# Checkout link charges

A checkout link can be used to handle both direct charges and recurrent charges. To create a checkout link, start by using the [Direct Charges API](#direct-charges) or [Recurrent Charges API](#recurrent-charges) to generate a charge object for the payment you want to collect.

The format of the charge link is: `https://livechat.com/marketplace/checkout/charge/<checkout_id>/<charge_type>?icon=<icon_url>&description=<transaction_description>`

Parameters description:

- `<checkout_id>` - ID of your registered charge object
- `<charge_type>` - type of the charge (`recurrent_charge` or `direct_charge`)
- Query params (optional):
  - `icon` — the icon shown in the transaction modal, accepts a link to the image
  - `description` - an additional description of the transaction shown in the modal

An example checkout link will look like this:

<CodeSample path={'EXAMPLE MARKETPLACE CHECKOUT LINK'}>

```shell
https://www.livechat.com/marketplace/checkout/charge/96381628-7977-4555-b397-4dbf2b4375ca/recurrent_charge
?icon=https://icon.com/xyz
&description=Some%20details%20about%20the%20transaction
```

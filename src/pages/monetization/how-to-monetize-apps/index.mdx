# Introduction

Whether your app is already up and running or you're just starting off, the topic of **app monetization** will eventually cross your mind. If you don't know how to go about generating income from your LiveChat or HelpDesk apps, this is the place for you to start.

There are a few ways in which you can monetize your apps, which include:

- Using the **App Monetization building block** for subscriptions or one-time payments. This option lets you implement out-of-the-box monetization directly in the Developer Console, with no additional development required.
- Collecting payments through an **in-app modal** using the Agent App SDK.
- **Redirecting users to the Marketplace checkout** via a link generated with the Billing API.
- Implementing a **custom payment solution** with the available **Billing API** methods.

## App Monetization building block

This is the easiest and the simplest form of monetizing your apps. The App Monetization building block allows you to set up a one-time payment or a subscription for the customers who want to use your application.

The entire App Monetization block configuration takes place in the Developer Console. You can read a step-by-step guide on setting this up [here](getting-started/app-guides/app-monetization).

## In-app payment modal

The Agent App SDK enables payment collection at any place within your application using the Billing API under the hood. Customers will be able to complete or cancel transactions through a customizable payment modal without leaving the Agent App interface.

## Checkout link

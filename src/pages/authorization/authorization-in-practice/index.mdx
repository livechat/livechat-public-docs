This tutorial guides you through the **Authorization Code Grant** flow, which is typical for server-side apps. As an example, we'll show you how to <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/#list-chats" target="_blank">list chats</a> using <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/" target="_blank">the Agent Chat Web API</a>.

Together, we'll go through the following steps:

1. Configuring the Authorization building block of your app

2. Acquiring the code

3. Exchanging the code for an access token

4. Sending a request

# Before you start

Make sure you have:

- a LiveChat Owner or Admin account. <a href="https://accounts.livechat.com" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for free if you don't have it.
- a **server-side application** in Developer Console. [Find out how to create one.](/getting-started/guides/#creating-livechat-apps)
- correct **scopes** for the selected method. [See documentation.](/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/#list-chats)
- any tool that will allow you to send requests (Postman, terminal, etc.)

# Step 1 Configure the Authorization building block

To use any method from the Agent Chat, Customer Chat, and Configuration API, your app needs to have an **Authorization** building block. This is where you'll configure authorization details.

![LiveChat Developer Console](/images/authorization/livechat-authorization-block-2x.png)

In the **Authorization** building block of your app, you'll find the fields you need to go through the authorization process:

- **Client Id**, which is the identifier of your app. It's considered public info.
- **Client Secret**, which is a confidential identifier. We will use in Step 3. **Copy it** as once you refresh the page, it won't be visible. **Store it in a safe location**. In production apps, Secret is usually stored on a server.

![LiveChat Developer Console](/images/authorization/livechat-app-auth-2x-client-id.png)

- **Redirect URI whitelist** - the address of your app that will receive the **code** and **access token** in a URL. Using only this address one can acquire a code or token. App users will be redirected to this address after successful authorization.
- **Access scopes** - most method require certain scopes. <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/#list-chats" target="_blank">See the API documentation </a> to find out what scope your app needs to use the List Chats method.

![LiveChat Developer Console](/images/authorization/dev-console-livechat-auth.png)

When it's all set, we can proceed with code generation. Make sure to have your **Client Id**, **Client Secret**, and **Redirect URI** at hand.

# Step 2 Acquire the code

Start by pasting your **Client Id** and **Redirect URI** in the following request:

```shell
https://accounts.livechat.com/
?response_type=code
&client_id=<CLIENT_ID_HERE>
&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI_HERE>
```

For **Client Id: d1ed7b4c40468710e7d3087483287637** and **Redirect URI: https://www.livechat.com/**, the request looks like this:

```shell
https://accounts.livechat.com/
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=d1ed7b4c40468710e7d3087483287637
  &redirect_uri=https://www.livechat.com/
```

Paste this snippet in the browser and copy the returned value. Make sure you're logged in to the exact same LiveChat account that was used to create the app in Developer Console. Otherwise, you'll be asked to log in first.

```shell
https://www.livechat.com/?code=dal%3Al2C-UBgvQHCuxqPlVmRG1A&state=
```

![LiveChat Developer Console](/images/authorization/livechat-authorization-code.png)

If you ever get a code or a token that contains **`%3A`**, change it to **`:`** (a colon). Normally, URL encoding replaces **`:`** with **`%3A`**. In that case, the code looks as follows:

```shell
dal:l2C-UBgvQHCuxqPlVmRG1A
```

Normally, at this point during app installation, the app asks users to access certain resources of their accounts. If they agree, they are redirected to the **Redirect URI** defined in Developer Console with `code` in the response.

# Step 3 Exchange the code for an access token

Now we have to exchange `code` for `token` to authenticate the identity of our application.

To do that, we'll send an HTTP POST request providing `code`, **Client Id**, **Client Secret**, and **Redirect URI**. To do that, we'll use Postman.

```shell
curl "https://accounts.livechat.com/token" \
  -X POST \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code&\
  code=dal:l2C-UBgvQHCuxqPlVmRG1A&\
  client_id=d1ed7b4c40468710e7d3087483287637&\
  client_secret=YOUR_SECRET_HERE&\
  redirect_uri=https://www.livechat.com/"
```

You'll get an object with not only the **access token**, but also the refresh token, scopes, expiration time, and other.

Remember the access token doesn't belong to you as an agent. It's **the token of your application** - that's why you specify **Client Id** in the request.

# Step 4 Send a request

Managed to get your token? Great! You can now use it to authorize the request sent the **List Chats** request.

Go to <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/#list-chats" target="_blank">List Chats</a> in our documentation and copy the request code snippet. Once more, we'll use Postman and its **Import > Paste Raw Text** option. Replace _<your_access-token>_ with the actual token and click **Import**.

![LiveChat Postman Authorization](/images/authorization/livechat-send-request.png)

Once you click **Send**, you should be able to get the response:

# Questions?

And that would be about it! We hope you managed to successfully send the request. You can use your access token for other methods from the Agent Chat and Configuration APIs. Remember that you cannot use the same token for **Customer Chat API**. Instead, use the token you have for [creating a customer](/authorization/authorizing-api-calls/#creating-a-new-customer), and acquire a new one.

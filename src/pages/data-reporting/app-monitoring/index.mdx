# Introduction

App monitoring is a tool that lets you to make use of the Platform reporting feature. Log errors that occur in your application and analyze data in the <Placeholder id="DEVELOPER_CONSOLE_URL" />. This funtionality allows you monitor the performance of your app without implementing a complex analytics solution.

There are two ways to report errors:

- [Monitoring API](#monitoring-api) (framework-agnostic)
- [Developer SDK](#developer-sdk) (JavaScript)

## App ID

Whiever method of logging events you choose, you'll need to know your __App ID__ (`appId` param).

ðŸ’¡ How to find App ID? Go to __Developer Console > Apps > Overview__ or extract it from the URL: `https://platform.text.com/console/apps/{appId}/monitor`

<div style={{maxWidth: "600px", marginBottom: "10px"}}>
  <img alt="AppId in Developer Console" src="/images/data-reporting/appId-developer-console.png" width="1340px" height="432px"/>
</div>

# Monitoring API

## Events

Log events such as 4xx or 5xx errors that occur in your application. You need to provide `appId` in the endpoint.

    "organization_id": "3aa138c1-c137-41c6-6b26-cface5857378",
    "type": "4xx",
    "payload": "404 Not found"

</Code>

# Developer SDK

If your app uses JavaScript, you can make use of the `sendError()` method from Developer SDK to achieve the same result as with the `/events` endpoint.

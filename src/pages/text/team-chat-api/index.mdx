# Introduction

Team Chat API by Text is a backend service that allows for a two-way communication between users using the HTTP protocol (Web reference). It supports the communication between agents/team members, not between customers and agents.

Team Chat API won't let you customize the LiveChat application, but it will let you build your own chat application from scratch.

## Features

- Communication can happen on public channels or via direct messages
- Storing messaging history
- Users can see messages that were sent before they joined the channel

## Web reference

The Web Reference section contains information about the Team Chat API's RESTful API and is available in the OpenAPI format.

## FAQ

### Is Team Chat API the same as Agent Chat API?

No. Team Chat API is a separate service independent of the LiveChat product.

### Can I use Team Chat API to chat with customers?

Team Chat API was designed for building custom chat applications for internal communication (agent - agent; team member - team member).

### Can I build apps for LiveChat with Team Chat API?

It's not designed for building apps for LiveChat. If you're looking for a solution to chat with customers, you should use the [Agent Chat API](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/) and [Customer Chat API](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/customer-chat-api/).

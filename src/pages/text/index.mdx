# Text Universe

<a href="https://text.com/universe" target="_blank">Text Universe</a> makes it possible to build powerful products using advanced text operations: text analytics, event-based messaging, omnichannel APIs, and many more.

## Text API

Part of the Text Universe is **Text API**, which currently offers language detection capabilities you can implement in your applications.

### Language detection

Language detection allows you to detect languages used in a message or a document. It can be very useful in all kinds of translator apps, advanced reporting, or auto replies.

# Introduction

<a href="https://text.com/universe" target="_blank">Text Universe</a> allows you to build powerful products using various Text operations like <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/data-and-reporting/" target="_blank">Text analytics</a> or <a href="https://developers.livechat.com/omnichannel/" target="_blank">Omnichannel APIs</a>. To make your experience even more prosperous and precious, we decided to open Text APIs to the public so you can freely discover, experiment, and build diverse applications.

## Language detection

Language detection allows you to detect languages used in a message or a document. It can be very useful in all kinds of translator apps, advanced reporting or auto replies.

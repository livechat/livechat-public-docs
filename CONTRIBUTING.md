## I have a problem with the LiveChat App

If you've run into problems with our LiveChat Application (setting it up, trobule with configuration, not receiving chats), [contact our 24/7 support](https://direct.lc.chat/1520/125), who specialize in solving such cases.

Please, don't create an issue in this repository.

## I'm building an app for the Marketplace and I got stuck

We've been there 😅. If you're stuck in the development process, constantly getting an error from our APIs, contact us at developers@livechat.com or [hop on Discord](https://discord.gg/rFbJkYQFwp).

## I found a bug/typo in your documentation

This is what we're here for.

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a separate branch for your changes.
3. Make the changes. You can find the documents in `src/pages/`.
When commiting, use the past tense ("Added description").
4. Submit a PR. You can skip most info in the PR template (e.g. Jira issue), but **provide the description**.
5. Wait for the review. We'll provide feedback or approve it right away.

## I have an improvement suggestion for the docs

We welcome all improvement suggestions: new document ideas, new functionality for the documentation website, etc.

The best way to give your feedback is to either send us an email at developers@livechat.com or let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rFbJkYQFwp).

## I have a problem with the LiveChat App

Please, don't create an issue in this repository.

## I'm building an app for the Marketplace and I got stuck

We've been there üòÖ. If you're stuck in the development process, constantly getting an error from our APIs, contact us at developers@text.com or [hop on Discord](https://discord.gg/rFbJkYQFwp).

## I found a bug/typo in your documentation

This is what we're here for.
